**Bhrugu Valli  
Anuvaka 1**

**भृगु॒र्वै वारु॒णिः। वरुणं॒ पित॒रमुपससार। अधीहि भगवो॒ ब्रह्मेति। तस्माए॒तत्प्रोवाच। अन्नं प्रा॒णं चक्षुः॒ श्रोत्रं॒ मनो॒ वाच॒मिति। तꣳहोवाच। यतो॒ वाइ॒मानि॒ भूतानि॒ जायन्ते। येन॒ जातानि॒ जीवन्ति। यत्प्रयन्त्य॒भिसंविशन्ति।तद्विजिज्ञासस्व। तद्ब्रह्मेति। स तपोऽतप्यत। स तपस्त॒प्त्वा। १**

In Brahmanandavalli all topics have been discussed viz., tvam pada (jiva, through pancakosaviveka), tatapada (Isvara, through srishti prakriya in two places one in the beginning andanother at sokamayata) and asi pada (one at ananda atma brahmapuccham pratishtha andanother at sa yascayam purushe..). The result was also thoroughly discussed. There is nothingnot discussed. All preparations have been discussed in Siksha valli. What for is the thirdchapter? We can see three topics in third chapter.

Highlights importance of a guru and approach of sishya to guru and their samvada. Anuprasnah alone indicated the presence of guru and sishya. In Vedanta there is nocorrespondence course possible.

The importance of tapas. Tapas has a different meaning in Vedantic context. In karma kandacontext it has the meaning of self-denial. Kayaklesa. If body is given to luxuries and comforts,body begins to command me. So I deny comforts to myself now and then. Here tapas is senseand mind control. Manasah indriyanam ca Aikagryam (Sankara gives). Tapas also meansaalocane (Suresvara says). In enquiry. Student should actively participate in the enquiry. Notpassive listening. Active listening means going along with the teacher and it also involveslater independent reflection.

Some more upasanas. Already some mentioned in first valli. If someone has not preparedproperly, the teacher wants to make sure that the problem with the student and not with him orsastra. So go through some more preparations and again come back to Brahmanandavalli.

It is called Bhrgu Valli. Because begins with Bhrugu. For this chapter also we have samesanti patha as previous one. Sahanavavatu+ The text begins with a story. The story is: Therewas a great rishi known as Bhrugu. Atri bhrugu+ One of the seven rishis. he is the son ofVaruna Devata. Vai is to indicate it is story. Upanishad is recollecting. What did he do? Heapproached his father one day. What is the big news in it? Train came to the station. It is not anews. Son approaching father is great news here because it is special son approaching specialfather for special purpose. He does not address him as Oh dad! But O Lord. Please teach meabout Brahman. It is within quotation. It is quoting Bhrugu's words. Thus he addressed hisfather. This much is story.

What is the purpose of the story? We are interested in teaching. Somebody might have taughtsomebody else. Why should Upanishad be particular about Bhrugu approaching Varuna.These are incidental details which can be omitted. Why this detail? There is a purpose in this.



It is glorification of vidya. What is the great glory of this vidya? It is not discovery of a singleindividual. It is learned by sishya from guru. It has come down from guru-sishya parampara.Its beginning we cannot trace. Sanatana dharma it is. It has not been given out by a givenindividual in a particular time.

This has been taught by father to his son. So we need not doubt the validity of this teaching.We can trust it because father will never mislead his son.

Here the student happens to be Bhrugu. Bhrugu is a highly learned person. But when hewanted to gain brahmavidya, he did not attempt himself. But he was humble enough toapproach his father. Narada has all knowledges. He is very famous person. For a famousperson alone it is very difficult to approach another person to learn. He goes to Sanatkumara.Bhrugu represents humility in learning this vidya. Because he is father, because there iscloseness, he could have taken his father for granted. So he decided to go specially to hisfather looking him as teacher.

Finally jnanis were not only among sanyasis. There were equally great jnanis amonghouseholders also. So we have pravritti marga parampara as well as nivritti marga parampara.Like Varuna-Bhrugu. Most important of all this importance of guru.

When a sincere student asks a teacher, the teacher also must be serious. Generally father doesnot respect the words of son. Whenever he asks something, he brushes aside. However sillythe question may appear, guru has to take it seriously and answer it seriously. Varuna alsotakes it seriously. Varuna tells the following to him. Tasmai etat provaca is Sruti telling. Whatfollows is within quotation. It is statement of Varuna.

In this chapter, the independent enquiry that is the tapas is going to be highlighted. So teacheris not going to spoon-feed the student. He is only going to give some clues on the teaching.Student has to work on the clues of the teacher and arrive at the final teaching. Importance oftapas is highlighted. Here the teacher gives some clues on tvam pada as well as tatpada.Student must work out and see the identity. Clues on tvam pada are: Annam etc relate to jiva.Annam refers to annamayakosa. So too pranam. Manas is manomayakosa. Eyes etc refer tosense organs and organs of action. Sense organs belong to manomaya and organs of actionbelong to pranamaya. Other two we have to imply. Again the teacher talked to him. Tam+This is again sruti's words. Now what follows is guru's words and within quotation. Nowsome clues on tatpada, Brahman. What is Brahman? It is beautifully defined as jagat karanam.Which cause? Material cause.

What is the definition of material cause. That from which something is born, that by whichsomething is sustained and unto which that thing goes back. Srishtimatra karanam is nimittakaranam. Pot maker is only nimitta karanam. He just creates. Sustenance is taken care of bybuyer. Clay is material cause. Brahman is upadana karanam for the entire world. That is whatis said here. Yatah+. Bhutani here means living beings. If jivanti is there, it is beings. Yatprayanti abhisamvisanti. They all go towards that Brahman. What is meant here is Nothinghappens suddenly. Everything is happening gradually. Prayanti means travelling towards theupadana karanam. Finally they merge into that. May you enquire into that material cause.Why I ask you to enquire. That material cause alone is Brahman. What was the question?Adhihi Bhagavah Brahma. I will not give all the clues. I will give some clues. It is cause ofsrishti sthiti and laya. If the teaching to be given completely, then teacher has to say that thatBrahman you are.



It is called savasesha bodhanam. Student has to enquire into this statement. He comes to knowthat such Brahman is there. It is paroksha jnanam. Through enquiry he has to arrive at that itis not some Brahman. I am that Brahman. To discover this, what did he do? He was brightand brilliant. He did enquiry. Tapas is not standing on one leg etc. Having done this enquiryfor some time, he came to some conclusion. Next anuvaka will talk about this.

The definition of Brahman given here is very famous. It is brahmalakshanam. This definitionhas been taken for enquiry in Brahmasutram. In the very second sutram, this mantra has beentaken for enquiry. There was another lakshanam given in second chapter. Satyam jnanam+ issaid to be svarupa lakshanam or direct definition. Here it is tatastha lakshanam. A thing isdefined in terms of its own nature in svarupa lakshanam. It is like defining a person in termsof his attributes. If I define the person as one who is sitting near the door. Through theexternal attribute, if something is pointed it is tatashtha lakshanam. World is not intrinsicnature of Brahman. So incidental definition. Bhrugu will do enquiry for ten / fifteen days.Then we will see.

Based on pancakosas and brahmalakshanam, the student has to make enquiry and discoverBrahman. Receiving this incomplete teaching, the student goes to make enquiry. Sah tapahatapyata - he did tapas. Because the teaching was incomplete, savasesha teaching. Thestudent cannot get direct knowledge based on this teaching. Now he knows Brahman is theultimate cause and from it world came and so on. It is to be known as myself. So Brghu didtapas. When mind and sense organs are withdrawn from outer things and applied in the fieldof enquiry, it is tapas. So he made an enquiry. Having made the enquiry, what knowledge hearrived at? That is said in the next section.

*पौनरुक्त्याभावात्।*)। (*इतष्टा न पौनरुक्त्यमित्याशयेन आह - अन्नादीति*) अन्नादिविषयाणि च उपासनानिअनुक्तानि (*अनुक्तानि वक्तव्यानि इति वचनविपरिणामेन अनुषङ्गः*) अतः इदमारभ्यते।

In the Anandavalli what is conveyed is said here briefly. Brahman which is satyam, jnanamand anantam, which is cause of space onwards and having created upto body, - all subtle andgross we have to understand - karye anupravesah then in the karya that is buddhi, the placewhere jagat is perceived or recognised - this Brahman is pointed. Vat is not like. It is matup.Brahman having visesha is veseshavat. visesha is buddhi etc. Kartrutvadi visesha. It hasattributes now. Became samsari. Brahman summa irunda sangai udi kedutthan. Like the thiefwho finished his job and found a sankha and wanted to test it. Caught. Brahman also like that.Created and got caught by entering it. Then samadhi shatka samaptti etc you have to gain. No- Visehsavat iva. It obtains in the buddhi without undergoing any change. Appears to havevisesha. Iva is the hetu. Therefore, it has no visesha. Being vivarta, therefore, it is distinctfrom all karyas. All namarupas. He brings everything here. Adrsyadi dharmakam meaningdrgsvarupam. It is anandam. (*the* *whole mimamsa is covered*). That may one recognised asoneself. Whole valli is in one sentence. Why this is so? Because the entry of Brahman ispresented only for that purpose viz. for knowing Brahman as atma. For one who hasunderstood in this form - Anandam brahman is me iti - good and bad actions - they do notbegin another janma for him. Why? They are seen in the form of self. So they are neutralised.Previously karta was seen and so they bound him. No karta is there. So badhitam bhavati.Brahmvidya was over by saying ityupnishad. Nothing is left. We can ask why the nextchapter for other texts. Not for Veda. What does it say - should be the approach. Any book,we should find out what is the vivakshita artha. An author has to prove the need for hiscommentary. They have to be defended. Not Sruti one has to defend.

All that is said here is not said before. That is the argument he gives for Sruti starting the nextsection. One thing highlighted here is tapas. Tapas is a beautiful word. Alocane.Indriyanigraha is commitment to the pursuit. Anything you want to accomplish, it is done bytapas alone. Like making money. Lottery buying is not tapas. You cannot come to Vedantaclass and make money. Once you have studied Vedanta, then it is different. Commitment isimportant. Application is necessary. She will not come unless you work for. It is calledindirya nigraha. Mind is not allowed to stray away on different things. You should haveniscaya as to what you want. This is general tapas. Here alocane. One is arat upakarakammeaning successively helpful. Yatah pravrittir+ Here siddhi he gains. Means is what? Byone's karma. How does he get it? Karma is arat upakarakam. It creates purity of mind andthen moksha. Like fire is mukhya sadhana. water etc is arat upakarakam. Vicara is important.Committed enquiry becomes means moksha. Indriyanigraha is also upakarakam. Sruti wantsto convey annadi upasanas also. The reverence to the world etc is important. All are isvara -this buddhi is necessary. That is created by the upasanas. They are all upakarakas. Not thatthey should be told. If elsewhere not said, it is assumed that you have got them when youcome to Vedanta. So the third valli is begun.

(*ननु तर्हि तप-आदिकमेव वक्तव्यं न तु आख्यायिकापि। तत्राह - आख्यायिकेति*) आख्यायिका विद्यास्तुतये। (*ननु आख्यायिकया कथं स्तुतिलाभः। तत्राह - प्रियाय इति। पिता पुत्राय प्रशस्तामेव विद्यामुपदिशेद् न अन्यामिति रीत्याविद्यायाः प्रकर्षः लभ्यते इत्यर्थः*) प्रियाय पुत्राय पित्रा उक्ता इति। भृगुर्वै वारुणिः। वै-शब्दः

Therefore, this is begun. Then begin sastra. Why Varuna etc. Let anybody talk. I do not care.No. This is called story. It is not that there is a plot etc. Mention of a name is a story. Onceupon a time this person Bhrugu who is prasiddha went to Varuna. It is meant for glorifyingvidya. How? Because father taught son. Father is the only person who will give everythingand he does want his son to become more knowledgeable than him. A teacher may not giveeverything as a father would. This is the assumption. So father hands over everything to hisson. This is the key. This is benami. This much money you have to collect form him. Theseare all hita. But still father does it. Brahmavidya is hitatama. Sometimes knowledge of specialmedicine - father will not tell anybody. He will tell only to his son and that too when he dies.The knowledge dies with him. Only one thing that keeps one away from fear of death etc isthis knowledge.

Number two is how this vidya should be gained. Father and son living in the same house. Tillthen he was visiting father every now and then. Why specially it is said, he approached. It hasgot to be asked for. Vidhi is there for approaching and asking. He did not ask dad what isBrahmavidya? Story tells all these things. The word Bhagavah also indicates this. His askingfor vidya also is included in vidhivat. Vidyastuti includes this also. The word vai is used torecollect something well known. Bhrugu became well known later. He is son of Varuna.There may be many Bhrugus like Venkataraman. Today he went to his father for money etc.But not like this. Today he went seeking this knowledge. Adhihi is ihi with adhi. Imperative.You do not require to remember anything. It is you. You are not to be remembered. When youwant to teach, you have to remember. Father also did not talk this to son so far. How itreveals that it is given for asking. We should not abuse words. Where are you going? I amgoing to satisfy annamaya kosa. Varuna did not want to remember but he did for his son. Butleft a lot for Bhrugu to do himself. He also did accordingly.

What did he say? Annam is Brahman. Pranam is Brahman. And so on. Then he pointed outthe lakshanam of Brahman called tatastha. Bhrugu must have been confused. Why this istold. First he said body. Then pranam is eater of food. Pranapanasamayuktam pacami. All

**१.** अन्नं शरीरमिति भोग्योक्तिः, शरीरस्य अन्नपरिणामत्वेन भोग्यत्वाविशेषात्। प्राणमत्तारमिति भोग्तोक्तिः।उपलब्धिसाधनानि भोगकरणानि इत्यर्थः। तथा च त्रितयं विचारार्थमुपदिष्टं भवति इति भावः। (टिप्पणी)



upalakshana for what is not said in senses etc. The eyes etc are means for recognisingBrahman. Adhishthanam is Brahman. For recognising it, they are means.

उक्त्वा च द्वारभूतान्येतान्यन्नादीनि तं भृगुं होवाच - ब्रह्मणो लक्षणम्। किं तत्। यतः यस्मात्वा इमानि ब्रह्मादीनि स्तम्बपर्यन्तानि भूतानि जायन्ते, येन जातानि जीवन्ति प्राणान् धारयन्तिवर्धन्ते, विनाशकाले च यत्प्रयन्ति यद्ब्रह्म प्रतिगच्छन्ति अभिसंविशन्ति तादात्म्यमेवप्रतिपद्यन्ते, उत्पत्तिस्थितिलयकालेषु यदात्मकतां न जहति भूतानि, तदेतद्ब्रह्मणो लक्षणम्।तद्ब्रह्म विजिज्ञासस्व\> विशेषेण ज्ञातुमिच्छस्व \> यदेवं लक्षणं ब्रह्म तदन्नादिद्वारेणप्रतिपद्यस्व इत्यर्थः।

By these words, the adhishthanam is indicated. It is pratyagatma. It is Brahman. Its lakshanamis sarvasya karanam. This he said to Bhrugu. The tatastha lakshanam is sakhagra candrah.Svarupa lakshanam is prakrishta prakasah candrah. Tip of the branch has nothing to do withmoon. Light has something to do with moon. When cause is said, what is that cause? It is eyeof eye etc is svarupa lakshanam. By that tatastha lakshanam we understand Brahman as cause.karya is mithya, karanam is satyam etc he has to do tapah. By anvaya vyatireka is tapas.

Beginning from Brahma to blade of grass or a worm. Nothing is omitted. Sarvam meanseverything. So both nimittam and upadanam yatah can mean. Here it is resolved by sayingsustenance of them. Yena - because of whose niyama, command or anja, they are all living,one can explain sthiti also to nimitta karanam. Laya seals it to upadana karanam. Upadanakarana which is nimitta karanam. Sarvani bhutani - it is said. So pralaya kale. Beings do notgive up which svarupa at any time, viz., all the three times that are possible. Is there any otherkala? No. In old age - that is also sthiti. Disease - sthiti. They do not give up the svarupa ofwhich in all these three periods of time. Karyakarana sanghata of everyone is born fromwhich etc is the eye of eye etc, pratyagatama etc. This has to be connected. One ispratyagatma. Other is karyakarana sanghata. Both have to be connected. Visesha jnana is asmijnanam. May you desire to know. Know through these annam etc. Understanding what isannam etc.

(*अन्नादेः ब्रह्मोपलब्धिद्वारत्वमन्यत्रापि प्रसिद्धमित्याह - श्रुत्यन्तरम् इति*) श्रुत्यन्तरम् - प्राणस्य प्राणमुतचक्षुषप्टाक्षुरुत श्रोत्रस्य श्रोत्रमन्नस्यान्नं मनसो ये मनो विदुः ते निचिक्युः ब्रह्म पुराणमग्र्यम् (*बृ.४.४.१८)* *(षष्ठ्यन्तप्राणादिशब्दोपात्तस्य कार्यकरणसंघातस्य अधिष्ठानतया सत्तास्फूर्त्तिप्रदं द्वितीयन्तप्राणादिशब्दोपात्तंप्रत्यगात्मानं ये श्रुतिन्यायाभ्यां विदुः ते सृष्टेः पूर्वकाले अपि स्थितं कूटस्थं ब्रह्म आत्मत्वेन निचिक्युः जानीयुः न इतरेप्रत्यगात्मस्वरूपज्ञानरहिताः इति श्रुत्यन्तरार्थः*) इति ब्रह्मोपलब्धौ द्वाराणि एतानि इति दर्शयति। स भृगुःब्रह्मोपलब्धि-द्वाराणि ब्रह्मलक्षणम् च श्रुत्वा पितुः (*पितुरिति पञ्चमी। तस्मात् श्रुत्वा* *इत योजना*) तपःब्रह्मोपलब्धि-साधनत्वेन अतप्यत तप्तवान्॥

Why not Kena quoted? There annasya annam is not there. That which is not prana but withoutwhich there is no prana. Not that there is another respiratory system. Yasya satta spurtipradanenaadhisthanam. Uta means and. It is eye of eye, prana of prana. Means it is neithereye or prana. It is not even vritti. Those who know this. They recognise Brahman. Puranammeans existent before srishti. This sruti shows that for the recognition of Brahman, eyes etc



are dvaras or means. Bhrugu having listened to. Thinking mind never understands - discoverthis. Zen like practice. So you can never think. Bhrugu thought he has to connect it. He didtapas.

(*ननु पित्रा तपसा ब्रह्म विजिज्ञासस्व इत्यनुक्तत्वात् कथं तपसि ब्रह्मविज्ञानसाधनत्वं भृगुणा विनिष्ठितम्। न हि तन्निष्टायंविना तत्र प्रवृत्तिः तस्य संभवति इत शङ्कते - कुतः पुनः इति*) कुतः पुनः उपदिष्टस्य एव तपसःसाधनत्वप्रतिपत्तिः भृगोः। (*परिहरति - सावशेषः इति*) सावशेषोक्तेः। (*गुरूक्तार्थानुवादपूर्वकं तदुक्तेःसावशेषत्वं साधयति - अन्नादीत्यादिना) अन्नादिब्रह्मणः प्रतिपत्तौ द्वारम्। (ब्रह्मणः प्रतिपत्तौ द्वारभूतं अन्नादिकं“अन्नं प्राणम्” इत्यादिना उक्तवान् इत्यर्थः*) लक्षणं च यतो वा इमानि इत्याद्युक्तवान्। सावशेषं हि तत्।(*यद्भूतजन्मादिकारणं तद्ब्रह्म, तत्प्रतिपत्तौच अन्नादि द्वारम् इत्येतादृशमुपदेशनं सावशेषमिति)।*साक्षाद्ब्रह्मणोऽनिर्देशात्। *(त्वं ब्रह्म इत्यपरोक्षतया ब्रह्मणो निर्देशाभावादित्यर्थः)*। अन्यथा हि(*सावशेषत्वाभावे हि*) स्वरूपेण एव (प्रत्यक्त्वेन एव इत्यर्थः) ब्रह्म निर्देष्टव्यं (*भृगोर्वास्तवस्वरूपज्ञाने ताटस्थ्यंवारयति - जिज्ञासवे इति*) जिज्ञासवे (*गुरोर्वास्तवस्वरूपबोधने उपेक्षां वारयति - स्वपुत्राय इति*) स्वपुत्रायइदमित्थंरूपं ब्रह्म इति। (*"इदं त्वया पृष्टं ब्रह्म, इत्थं रूपं तव देहे बुद्ध्यादिसाक्षितया उपलभ्यमानचैतन्यरूपम्"इति निर्देष्टव्यमिति योजना*)। न च एवं निरदिशत्। (*अनुपलम्भात्*)। किं तर्हि। सावशेषमेवोक्तवान्।अतः अवगम्यते नूनं साधनान्तरम् (*स्वस्मिन् विधिवदुपसदनादिलक्षणं यत्साधनमस्ति तदपेक्षयाअन्यत्साधनमित्यर्थः*) अपेक्षते पिता ब्रह्मविज्ञानं प्रति इति।

How for Bhrugu, this understanding that tapas is the sadhana took place. Varuna did not sayat this point that know by tapas. How did he figure out. Savasesha ukti is the hetu. Thestatement of Varuna is incomplete. So he has to do vicara. Knowledge depends on vicara.Guru himself can explain completely. But here it is incomplete. Bhrugu has to supply themissing link. Because Brahman has not been directly pointed out as the self. If it is notsavasesha, then it should have been pointed out in this manner as Brahman is of this nature. Ifit is not his own son, then he may not have given full teaching. Since it is his own son, heshould have told this way. But he did not. So it is incomplete teaching. Among many othersadhanas, why should he choose tapas? Diet etc does not help to connect two ideas exceptvicara. This teaching on the part of Varuna therefore is savasesha and tapas is required. Fatherdesires iti Bhrugu decides. He chooses it also. Though karma and upasana also there. BeingVaruna's son, he had desire to know and so he could discern tapas is the sadhanam required.

तपोविशेषप्रतिपत्तिस्तु सर्वसाधकतमत्वात् (*औषधान्यगदाः विद्या दैवी च विविधा स्थितिः। तपसैव प्रसिद्ध्यन्ति तपस्तेषां हि साधनम्॥ मनु ११.२३५। यद्दुस्तरं यद्दुरापं यद्दुर्गं यच्च दुष्करम्। सर्वमेतत् तरसा साध्यं तपोहि दुरतिक्रमम्। २३६*) सर्वेषां हि नियतसाध्यविषयाणां (*नियतत्वं ऐकान्तिकफलत्वम्। तेन नियतसाध्येन* *सहसाधनतया संबद्धानाम्)* साधनानां तप एव साधकतमं साधनमिति हि प्रसिद्धं लोके *(ब्रह्मविद्व्यवहारेप्रसिद्धत्वात्*)। तस्मात् पित्रा अनुपदिष्टमपि ब्रह्मविज्ञानसाधनत्वेन तपः प्रतिपेदे भृगुः। तच्च तपःबाह्यान्तःकरणसमाधानं तद्वारकत्वाद् ब्रह्मप्रतिपत्तेः। “मनसश्चेन्दियाणां च ह्यैकाग्र्यं परमं तपः।तज्ज्यायः सर्वधर्मेभ्यः स धर्मः पर उच्यते"॥ इति स्मृतेः। स च तपस्त्प्त्वा॥

Tapas is most important thing. Committed pursuit is tapas. It is exalted among all tapas. In theworld it is well known that tapas is most important means for anything. Niyata... vishayanam



is adjective to sadhananam. Sadhana for which vishaya is that which has definite results. Youdo not allow yourself to be distracted by other things while doing one thing. That is tapas.This is general rule. Here the end being knowledge, it is vicara. Bhrugu understood tapas asmain means for brahmavidya.

What is that tapas? Samadhana of external organs is application. Disco and Ph.D cannot gotogether. You are all doing tapas only. Because there is only one thing. No TV. No Movie.Indriyas are simple reporters. They do not goad you. Fancies can raise in one's mind. Youhave to choose with which you will go along. It is lakshana. There is no control. Samadhanais the means for gaining knowledge. A smriti is quoted. Placing them in one thing is tapas.

Student had two clues. The first is he has an annamaya and second is that Brahman is upadanakaranam. He tried to join this definition and annamaya. Because all beings are made up ofannamaya. So he thought over and all these annamayas are born out of annam. Annamaya isborn of, sustained and resolve back into annam alone. Annam refers to samashti annam, thecause and annamaya refers to vyashti annam, the karyam. There we saw, the maya is a suffixadded in Sanskrit and when you add maya to the word, it indicates the product of that likesvarnamaya and mrnmaya. The very word annamaya indicates it is product of annam. Whenwe say svarnamaya, svarnam is cause and it is the product of svarnam. It is upadana karanam.Maya is added only to upadana karanam. You cannot say kulalamayah ghatah. Lohamayahpithah. When you say annamayam sariram. Sariram is product and annam is the materialcause. It is clear that annat upadanakarnat, annamaya ni bhutani jayante. Annenaupadanakaranena annamayani bhutani jivanti. Anne upadanakarane eva annamayani bhutaniliyante. The definition of Brahman is perfectly fitting withannam.Brahmalaksanam is yato+So what is Brahman? Annam. Annasya sarvaupadana karanatvat sarvesham bhutanamannakaryatvat ca. Bhrugu was happy. He knew Brahman as annam. After doing tapas, herecognised. To prove that he is correct, he is trying to fit in annam with the definition ofBrahman. If he has correctly discovered, the definition must fit. So he does that. From annamalone all these beings are born. Bhutani here means annamayani. Here annam stands for alltypes of food. In the place of yatah he replaces annam. That is why annam is said to be thatwhich consumes beings ultimately. Was happy for a minute. Further thought came and hewas not satisfied. Annam itself is subject to change. Yat svaikaram tat adyantavat. Whateveris subject to change has beginning and end. Vikaram are six in number. So destruction also isthere. Adyantavat is karyam. two steps. Savikaram is karyam. It cannot be mulakaranam.Ultimate cause. My parents can not be the ultimate cause. They themselves are product. Soannam cannot be final cause as it happens to be karyam. Brahman is mulakaranam. SoBhrugu got disappointed. Like Anjaneya who got disappointed when he saw Mandodari andconcluded as Sita but immediately discovered to be not Sita. How can Sita be sleeping withRavana. Bhrugu therefore went to the next class.

Again he went back to father, having taken annam to be Brahman. He asked him, father-cum-guru, please teach me Brahman. This is in quotes. Bhrugu's words. Varuna told him. Tam hauvaca. What did he say: Tapasa+ Bhrugu must have told all the details of his vicara. I thoughtannam is Brahman. Because it is cause of all beings. But I am not satisfied with thisconclusion. Therefore teach me. - All these we have to infer. Otherwise father will not know



whether enquiry is in right direction or not. Here father is confirming that the enquiry is in theright direction. He asks to continue the enquiry. From this we understand, the son must havetold him everything.

Father now says: May you know that Brahman by your own enquiry. You have to go furtherin your enquiry. Tapas is disciplined enquiry. Teacher goes one more step further. Rightenquiry itself is Brahman. Enquiry is sadhanam and Brahman is sadhyam. Sadhya-sadhanaaikya is pointed out. It is gauna prayoga. It is like telling money is everything. Does it meanmoney is breakfast.? You cannot eat money. Money is everything means, means foreverything. sadhanarthe sadhya lakshana. Tapas is Brahman means tapas is a means to knowBrahman. Thus father said. He did tapas. Other than annam there must be something elsewhich is the cause. Having done tapas, he comes to the next stage.

अन्नं ब्रह्मेति व्यजानात् विज्ञातवान्। तद्धि यथोक्तलक्षणोपेतम्। अन्नाद्ध्येव खल्विमानि भूतानिजायन्ते। अन्नेन जातानि जीवन्ति। अन्नं प्रयन्त्यभिसंविशन्तीति । तस्माद्युक्तमन्नस्यब्रह्मत्वमित्यभिप्रायः। स एवं तपः तप्त्वा अन्नं ब्रह्मेति विज्ञाय लक्षणेन उपपत्त्या च(*अन्नादिशब्दितस्य विराजः श्रुतिषु उपास्यत्वश्रवणाद् अब्रह्मणः उपास्यत्वायोगात् इत्यादि उपपत्त्या च विज्ञाय*) पुनरेवसंशयमापन्नः वरुणं पितरमुपससार। अधीहि भगवो ब्रह्मेति। कः पुनः संशयहेतुः अस्य इति,उच्यते - अन्नस्य उत्पत्तिदर्शनात्। तपसः पुनः पुनरुपदेशः साधनातिशयत्व-अवधारणार्थःयावद्ब्रह्मणो लक्षणं निरतिशयं न भवति. यावच्च जिज्ञासा न निवर्त्तते तावत् तपः एव तेसाधनम्। तपसा एव ब्रह्म विजिज्ञासस्व इत्यर्थः। एवं सर्वत्र। ऋज्वन्यत्।

Swami Dayanandaji

He connected neatly. All beings born of food. Sustained by food. Goes back to food. From thetoal, individual is born. Annatmakam jagat becomes the cause for world. Having known thus,he got doubt. He went to Varuna again. He must have told food is Brahman. He sent him backagain to do vicara. Varuna confirms tapas as means here. Like train going to Madras is calledMadras. Madras is standing in platform four. Tapas is therefore Brahman.

Bhashya

He understood food as Brahman. It is a level of understanding. It has brahmalakshanam.How? All pranadharis, living beings are born from food, virat. Andajam, svedajam udbijjamand jarayujam. Jivanam includes all growth etc. At the end, body goes back to virat. Virat isfive elemental world. That is why it never gets impoverished. Body cannot disappear. It goestowards food andmerges there, sastra says. Annam is badhitam. Badhayamsamanadhikaranyam. Because Prana is Brahman. And so on. Ananda is Brahman. There is nobadha. It is svarupa. In the temple there is mula deity and utsava deity. Mula is stone andutsavais bronze. Someone said, utsavar has gone out (on procession). When does mula deitywill go out. Because you have come, will he remain. he will also move out. Simialrly, wheneverything is badhayam samanadhikaranyam, do not ask ananda also similar. Having donethis tapas, applying lakshanam and upapaptti is connection. Then doubt comes. So he asks.Anna has beginning. Sruti said. So karya. 1) *smahatatvat* karyam. Again, 2) *pranam is notcovered.* That is also a basis for doubt. 3) *Annam alone does not cause* the body. Heap themtogether. Nothing is born. It has to be consumed by a live person. From life alone life is born.Without life, it is not possible. Whether it is microbe to maharaja, life from another life alone



like one lit candle alone can light up another candle. Associated with prana alone annam iscause. 4) Annam causes *durgandha and waste.* How can it be pure Brahman. He thereforeasks. Tapas is praised here by saying tapa is Brahman. Stuti is not just flattering. It is atechnical word. Highlighting qualities of a given subject matter etc. Praise has no flatteryhere. Acaryavan purusho veda. Acaryavatvam is praised. Jijnasa will go away only whenunderstanding is complete. Samadhanam means tattvavicara. It implies commitment also. Itis not slipshod enquiry.

On further enquiry, taking the clue of prana, which is interior to annam, he finds that allbeings are not essentially annamayam. Subtler than it is pranamaya. It is born ofsamasthiprana. By samasthi prana, all pranamayas are sustained. Unto it they all go back. Soprana is Brahman. He was very happy for a short while. how can prana be mulakaranam? It issubject to change. All are changing. When we look at our own prana, breathing is constantlychanging. So too digestary and circulatory and so on. Prana being savikara, it is karya. So itcannot be mulakaranam. He again goes to father and it is same like previous section. Prana isacetana. It does not think. It gives energy alright. Jnanasakti is only in the mind. Adhyatmikaprana can be controlled by the mind. Prana is in your hands, i. e mind. So he decides mind tobe Brahman. Aitareya Sruti says - the semen has to be dried to become a pinda in the form ofbody by prana entering it.

Swami Dayanandaji

Bhrugu did not get angry when he repeatedly says tapasa+. Everytime he went, there issraddha. So it paid him. Father did not contradict him at all. Everytime he got his approval.

Bhrugu does not give up. He understands vijananm to be Brahman. Mind also in the hands ofahankara. Vritti vikaras are known to ahamkara. Mahat tattvam is vijnanam. Ahamkara alsosushuptau laya darsanat. (Sw Paramarthananda - Mind here is samashti mind. In previouscases also samashti. How to differentiate between the vyashti and samasti. Maya added, it isvyashti. Here also definition fits. From the total mind, individual mind is born, sustained andgoes back. But mind also svikaram. While giving answer itself, it is changing. It cannot bemula karanam.)

Here also samashti is meant. We can call HG. Here also lakshanam fitting. So vijnanamBrahman. Not satisfied. Vijnanam also in the form of vrittis. Ghatavijnanam is ghata vritti.Vijnanam keeps changing. Savikaratvat karyam. Karyatvat na mula-karanam. Again goesback. Varuna does not become wild. He asks him to enquire further.

Swami Paramarthananda

Bhrugu came to the knowledge ananda is brahman. here we have to carefully note thatananda is not anandamaya kosa. Kosa is skipped here. It is the difference between 2^(nd) and 3^(rd)valli. Bhrugu understood anandamaya kosa also. This we have to supply. Ananda means herethe substratum of ananda, that is atma. It is not kosananda. It is atmananda. It is not reflectedananda that has gradations, but svarupananda. It is not available for experience. Kosanandacomes and goes. Ananda is caitanyarupah. Aham brahmeti vyajanat. He fits in definition. Allbeings are born out of ananda alone. How? It is not our happiness here talked about. It is notkosananda. Nothing is born out of it. Ananda should not be translated as happiness but atmacaitanyam. Sruti says, ananda that is atma from that all beings are born. Why ananda word isused. It is to show that ananda is also svarupam of atma like caitanyam. I know I amcaitanyam, but I do not have ananda - thus people will say. Now he was totally satisfied withthis knowledge. Earlier all were savikaram. So not ultimate cause. Caitanyam is notsavikaram, it is nirvikaram. Some reasons are:

It is witness of all changes. So free from changes.

If caitanyam is changing, then how do you see the change in ciatanyam. Somebody has toreport the change. You require another caitanyam to talk about the changes of the firstcaitanyam. But there is no second caitanyam to see the first. If one says, changing, then askhow do you know?

Why not caitanyam know its own changes. No instrument can know its own changes. Eyescan never see the properties or colours of eyes themselves. In the mirror you do not see youreyes. It is reflection of eyes. A guni can not know its own gunas. So no adyantavat and so notkaryam. So it is cause and ultimate. Causeless cause. Siva does not have father represents this.

Enquiry successfully completed. So no punareva. He told the king I want to teach bhagavata.King asks him to learn further as you have not completed. Few times he sent him like that.Then he does not come back. King went to him and requested him. So father must have goneto him and congratulated him. This vidya is known as Bhargavi or Varuni. This wisdombegan from anna and where was the culmination of enquiry? It came more and more interior.



It culminated in atma. Parama vyoma is space in the heart which is supreme space. Brahmanis manifest as cidakasa in heart alone. It is like garbhagriha. Caitanyam is the Lord there.Even though Lord is everywhere, but in temple Lord is invoked. So too Lord is pervading thebody and everything else. In hrdayam he is manifest. Why in hrdayam? Is it not in mind?Physical heart is locus of mind according to sastra. (*No spiritual heart meant by Sankara*). Inmind cidabhasa is there. In this mind he discovered Brahman. Yo veda nihitam+

Now phalam is said. It is for who ever gains the same knowledge. For any yuga it is same.One who knows thus he gains pratishtha, establishment in life. Like idol is installed insanctum, He will not go through ups and downs. He will have problems. But they do notaffect him. They lose their capacity to shake him. He is well installed. This is jivanmukti. Notonly he enjoys jivanmukti. He will enjoy even relative pleasures of life. He will have plentyof annam. He will be prosperous. He also will enjoy the food. He has no worry. He becomesgreat because of his wisdom. If sanyasi, praja is sishya. If sanyasi - ashram is wealth. Lot ofcattle, gosala. Mind is bright. So body also bright. Great by his fame also. All because ofteaching. They are not for his enjoyment.

Swamiji

In sleep ahamkara is not there. In ananda avastha also, there is no real ahamkara is not there.So he does not take bhokta also. It is another costume of ahamkara. He knows vijnanam alsonot Brahman. On further enquiry he discovers ananda to be Brahman. It is anantam. Anandamcannot exist without cetanam. It is pratyagatma which is cetanam. Asmi is sat. It is in theform of cit and anatam. From one way it is right to say all came from ananda. They go backmeans to sleep. He lives because joy keeps the fellow going. But that is not the exact point.Here not any other ananda. It is anantam Brahman from which everything is born and so on.

Here the lakshanam is complete. You cannot go further. Anantam is maximum. Yat iscompletely replaced by the word anandam. If ananda atma is born, Brahman is born. Thatcannot be. The ultimate cause has to be causeless. Why the story does not tell he came back.Did he not require father. No. The job is over. It is not a story for a movie. He came back andgave a hug to father. He said subham etrc. Story is intended for highlighting some values, thatis all. Enquiry is successful - this also is pointed out. Anyone also can discover like Bhrugu.Bhrugu must have come back and talked to his father. That is different thing.

Visuddha atma is one who has all qualifications. Hehas sraddha and capacity to do vicara.From what he has accomplished, we know this. By this, the necessity of visuddha mind ispointed out for knowledge. In annam etc he did not see lakshanam of Brahman in total.Gradually entering interior. Now no more possible to go inner. I is ultimate. No travelpossible. The highlight of valli is said by Bhashyakara here. Nothing new is gained by us. Fortatasthalakshanam iti you cannot say. That also talked. So for tapas sadhanam this chapter.

Now saisha.. is said by whom? Within the story, sruti has talked as Bhrugu went to Varunaetc. Here it is outside story. Story is over. It is given up. What is accomplished by the story istold here. The outcome of the story. It started from annamaya and pratishthita meansparisamapta. Where? In guha. In buddhi. Advaite means not any experiential happiness. It isnot brithright of Bhrugu. It is unlike a therapy. Anyone can do this and know AnandaBrahman. Since he is established in knowledge, he abides in ananda. What is pratishtha?Sankara answers. He becomes Brahman. Avidya is negated.

What is the seen result. He becomes annavan. matup means plenty. He has sishyas who willconsume. Otherwise, everyone is annavan. Because he is living. Without annam, body cannotsurvive. Without working for, he gains a lot of food. he is annadah. Is he not annada beforeknowledge. No. He has good health and appetite. His samana is jvalita, tended well.Bhagavan takes care. Because he eats a lot, he becomes mahan. No. By sishyas etc. he gainslot of cattle or wealth. Even if he does not have them, sarvam apnoti. Because srotriyasya +.Brahmatejas is born of Vedic study. Even a vendor discerns an Iyer. It is due to Gayatri. Kirtimeans he is recognised by society. His acara is in keeping with sastra. That creates fame. It isstuti of vidya. It is not totally literal. People always recognise vidvatta, saintliness or hiscompassion. People want such people. It is always true. Even if they want to live away fromsociety, people recognise.

Swami Paramarthananda

The topic of Brahmavidya is over. Upasana topic begins. Certain values are also taught.Upasanas are meant for manda or madhyama adhikari. By adhama adhiakri we mean one whohas not at all got citta suddhi. He is the lowest one. For him karmayoga is important. Formiddle one, upasana. For uttama adhiakri jnanam.

We are going to get a very interesting upasana. Everything in the world is interdependent andinterrelated or interconnected. Nothing is independent. The whole creation is one body andevery part is an organ. Just as our various organs are interconnected, so too the wholecreation. Our body tells this. When one part of the body is affected, the whole body isaffected. Diabetes - pancreas is affected. Soon it will affect kidney, eyes, brain. Any woundwill not get cured soon. At samashti level also, it is same. A man cannot live without thesupport of other beings. Everything is contributed by someone or another. Your dress,notebook, pen, body etc. This aspect is taught here. Upasana of the interdependence of thewhole creation.

The result is two. One is expanded vision. Our view is not short sighted. It becomes holisticvision. We cut the tress, pollute water and air. The whole earth will become unfit to live. Thisis happening because we are bothered about our interest only. We damage the whole. Theresult is we have to pay the price. Any food you take is poisoned. Chemicals are alreadyinside. Sanakra gives a second result that once you see the whole universe as the relative one,it proves that it does not have absolute reality. It is mithya. Whatever is interrelated is mithya.Interdependent, unrelated is mithya. Satyam is one which is not dependent on anything else. Itis independent. Non relational. Thus upasana will give expansion of vision and mithyatvabuddhi in the world.

By this meditation we will see the whole creation as one web where we cannot think of onewithout thinking of another and thus it will help in the expansion of the mind. Also humilitycomes with this upasana. Whenever we accomplish something, we say I did it. But we needthe support of so many people, forces etc. If we are able to conduct this class, how manyfactors are involved. So many people have worked together. That is why thanks giving isthere at the end of any programme. No one can claim glory for anything.

First we will see a value that is prescribed. A vrata is given. Then upasana. Vrata is may onenot do ninda of food. Vrata is value or discipline. Disregard or insult or disrespect. Annam is



food. Why not do ninda. Any reason you can give. 1) When annam is samashti, it is Virat. Asvirat, it has to be respected.2) When you look at vyashti level, it is annamaya. Annam atvyashti level also respected as annamaya. Why annamaya to be respected. a) That is the basicrequirement. Basic instrument. Sariram adyam+ A little hunger is there, you cannot listen.Body is necessary for all pursuits. b) It is stepping stone through which one goes topranamaya etc. It is gateway to Brahman. Just as temple door is respected, they touch andtake to eyes. it is gate to the Lord. So when we serve food, if it falls on the way, they removeit immediately. So that no body trample on it. like you do not step on book.

Now upasana. It is seeing the interdependence of things in the creation. As an example a pairof things are given. Prana and sariram. Prana, the life breadth and sariram the body. How theyare interrelated? prana and body are inter-related in the form of anna and annada sambandha.What do you mean by it? Literally annam is food. Annada is eater. Here who is eater and whois eaten? From one angle, prana is eater. Body is eaten. From another angle, body is eater andprana is eaten.

Prana if annam, body becomes annada. When prana is annada, sarira becomes annam. Wehave to add one more sentence, prano va annadah and sariram annam. How do you imagine?Sankara gives a clue. Prana is within our body. So prana is content in the body. Body iscontainer. Prana therefore can be compared to annam. Body is annada. As a content, prana isannam and as container sariram is annada. Next task is to reverse. Then prana is annada.Sariram is annam. Body becomes annam in which context? In pancakosa viveka context.Grosser kosams are resolved in to the subtler kosas. Annamaya is resolved in to pranamaya.Annamaya becomes eaten. Subtle one swallows the grosser one. So prana is eater. Body iseaten. In normal experience, it is reverse. Both are each. So too everything. I am giver in classand you are giver in dining hall. It is view point. So mithya. It is anna and annada sambandhaupasana of prana and body.

The same pair is going to be seen in another relationship. Pratishtha-pratishthita sambandha.Pratishtha means supporter. Pratishthitam means supported. Between prana and body. Bothare each from different angles. When body is container, body becomes supporter and prana issupported. Prana is life principle because of which alone body is alive. Here prana issupporter and body is supported.

See text. Thus one annam is supported by another annam. Prana is one annam and body isanother annam. One anna is supported by another anna. Similarly one annada is supported byanother annada. Annadamannade pratishthitam.

Phalam is given. One who meditates on this aspect of anna established in anna, he getssupport. As the upasana is, so the phalam. Since upasana is supporter-supported, I will getplenty of support. Other things are said before.

Anything striking is claimed by bhagavan. Then after listing he says whatever is glorious isme. This is recognising Isvara as everything. This is the reverence and simple understanding.It is a means for knowledge. Creation is his handiwork. That reverence is brought out here.Eater also is me. Eaten is me. I am good eater is also I cannot claim. In body etc, all areparamesvaras only. All are upalabdhi-sthanani. In all these you recognise the presence ofIsvara. In feet, there is capacity to walk. I manifest in that form. We should not dismiss thissection as simple upasana.

Bhashya

Do not censure food. Do not throw away food. It is simple empirical attitude towards food.We go one step further. Food is Brahman. Negation is not that annam is not Brahman.Brahman is much more than annam. Being mithya, as adhishthanam it is Brahman. It ismithya because eaten is eater. Eater is eaten. Both are Brahman. You are the eater and eaten.How mithya is and how it cannot be separate from Brahman. Everything is Brahman isbrought out here. Everything is reverential. Annam Brahma. So do not look down upon it.yadrcchaya ca upapannam adyat srestham uta avaram. It is rich food I cannot eat. That is notright.

Outside also annam. Body also annam. Since food is means for knowing Brahman, one notlook down upon food. Even if it is inferior. Not to your taste. Like Guru. No unlike. As youwould abuse guru, do not do like that. No. Na nindyat gurum iva. Isvaro gururatmeti. AnnamBrahman is annam is isvara. With reference to a created karya, Brahman is isvara. We neednot say have reverence for Isvara. Let this be vrata for mumukshu. Brahmavid is

brahmaupasaka. Looking upon Jagat as Isvara, jagat as reverential is vrata i.e., niyamenaanushthitam is vow.

It is for the stuti of annam. How annam gets this status of object of praise. Because, it ismeans for knowing Brahman. Also brahma-karyatvat. So brahmaupalabdhi upaya. Fromkarya you recognise karana.

Here is a magic. Annam is that which is eaten. Prana is annam. Pranapana samyuktah+ Pranais eaten. Anything inside the body is annam. Food goes inside after eaten. prana obtains in thebody. Prana itself is modified form of annam. If annam is not there, prana will go away. Pranadepends on annam. Annam to be eaten, depends upon prana. So mutual dependence. How?Because both are Brahmasraya. Both reveal Brahman as satyam. Like food, prana is insidebody. So prana is annam. Prana sustains by food. Annakarya is prana.

That which obtains within something else, that becomes the anna of that other. This is a wayof looking at things. Annada becomes annam and anna becomes annada. This is what Srutiwants to say. Everything is born out of one karanam. Hence it is so. Similarly body becomesannam. Prana, the brahmatma becomes annada. Without prana, body has no existence. Sowhich is asraya and which is asrita difficult to say. So it is mithya. Anyah anyasminpratishthitam. So both are annam. Anyah anyasya pratishtha. So both are annada. Brahman isboth. One who meditates that Brahman as anna or annada is established in the other gainspratishtha. He does not get isolated. Entire jagat is annam. Viradatma. Eater-eaten bheda,separation is not there means isolation is gone. He remains as sarvatma at that level as anna-annada. Isvara as karyatma is always for uapsana. Or it is to gain attitude based onunderstanding.

Swami Paramarthananda

Of the three pairs, prana and body was first pair. Prana and body has anna and annadasambandha and pratishtha and pratishthita sambandha. Anna annada was from the angle ofprana being content and body being container. As content prana is anna and as container bodyis annada. Similarly pratishtha and pratishthita. As life receiver body is supported and as lifegiver prana is support. Similarly reverse also applies. Prana is annam and body is annada fromthe angle of resolution of pancakosa viveka. Annamaya kosa is eaten by pranamaya kosa. Asresolved body is annamaya and prana as resolver is annada. So too pratishtha/pratishthita. Ascontent prana is pratishthita and as container body is pratishtha.

Here another pair for upasana and value. Value is do not waste or throw away annam. Weshould not leave annam. As children we are told. It is in our tradition. Putting so much on theleaf and struggling is not right. Over eating also insult to annam. This is vratam.

The second pair was water and fire. Anna-annada smabandhavat and pratishtha-pratishthitasambandhavat. Here also same upasana. Waters and fire. Water is annam, eaten by the firethat is eater whenever we drink water. It is digested by viassvaranara agni. It is jatharagni. Asdigester, fire is eater. Water is eaten. During pralaya, earth resovles in water. Water resovlesin fire. Fire is eater of water. Second part is fire is annam, eaten and water is eater, annada.Water eats fire. Fire is eaten. As quencher of fire, water becomes annada when you pourwater on fire. As quenched one, fire becomes annam. When there is fire accident, we pourwater. Water consumes fire.

So too water and fire are supporter-supported. How? Water is supporter. Fire is supported.From one angle water is supporter of fire. How? If you look at your own body, body has gottemperature. You know this temperature is maintained always. If it goes high, there is feverand death. Low also you will die. There is thermostat working. Even in Kashmir, bodytemperature is maintained. In summer, in gulf, it is maintained. Water alone is maintainingthat. You keep on sweating. It is heated water removed and you keep drinking fresh water.Water serves as thermostat. A person who had defective birth and this thermostat was notworking. The child was put in special encasement and they had certain special circulation andall, and if it was not done. it would have died. Bhagavan has given beautiful system. But wedo not recognise that. Water is pratishtha and fire is pratishthita. As maintainer of body heat,it is pratishtha. As maintained, it is pratishthitam. One commentator gives another peculiarexample. He gives the phenomenon of lightning. During rainy season when clouds are full of



water at that time alone lightning comes. Lightning is energy or fire only. So water in theatmosphere is maintaining lightning which is fire and so water in the clouds is supporter andfire in the form of lightning is supported. The idea is you should see the inter-relationship.

Similarly in another angle, water becomes supported and fire is supporter. Roles are reversed.. From the creation angle, we can find, from fire came water. Cause is fire and water is effect.Cause sustains the effect. Fire as cause is pratishtha and water as effect is pratishthitam.

We have to put apo va annada and jyotih annam iti (*we have to supply*). So too supporter-supported both ways. What is the conclusion? Tadetat+ One annam is supported by anotherannam. We have to add also annadah annade pratishthitah. One annada is supported byanother ananda. Because both are annam and both are annadas. Since a person meditatesabout support, the phalam of the meditation is that he will also get plenty of support in hislife. People ask for support. I want physical support because I am growing old. I wantfinancial support because I have lot of expenditure. I aleast want moral support like some kindwords. Here the result is that support. Not only that. He gains annam etc.

अन्नं न परिचक्षीत न परिहरेत्। तद्व्रतम्। (*शरीरप्राणोभयमन्नान्नादत्वगुणकम् उपासीनस्य अन्नापरिहाराख्येव्रते विवक्षिते सति अर्थाद् अन्नस्तुतिरपि पूर्ववद् लभ्यते इत्याशयेनाह - पूर्ववत् स्तुत्यर्थम् इति*) पूर्ववत्स्तुत्यर्थम्। तदेव शुभाशुभकल्पनया अपरिह्रियमाणम् स्तुतं = महीकृतम् अन्नं स्यात् (*तदेवअन्नम्* *अपरिह्रियमाणं सत् स्तुतम् स्यादिति संबन्धः*।) (*लोको हि अन्ने* *शुभाशुभशब्दितौगुणदोषौ कल्पयित्वागुणवदन्नमुपादत्ते, दोषवदन्नं* *परिहरति, तथा न परहरेदिति व्रतोपदेशः*।)। एवं यथोक्तमुत्तरेषु अपि आपो वाअन्नं इत्यादिषु योजयेत्।

Pujya Swamiji

Do not throw away food. Why? It is for stuti. It is isvarasvarupam. Why people throw away?It is good or it is not good iti. Annam is annam. Good and not good are kalpana. Kalpana ismeant for pure subjective projections. Not for really avaram annam. That there is no masala inthe food or there is no mustard oil in the food. That which is not thrown away because of suchthinking. That act shows reverence for food.

Apa vai annam. Water taken is annam. It is inside once drunk. Again after sometimes youwant water again. It is evaporated by the fire that is there in the stomach. Jyotih is fire. Vedafollows grammar. Jyotih is neuter. So annadam. It is not ikaranta. It is sakaranta. In the formof sweat and all it goes out. Fire being cause, water is supported by fire. Body temperaturewill go away, if water is not there. So in water alone, fire is supported. In karya is karana andvice versa like seed and tree. Everything depends on one satyavastu which is free from anyrelationship. If the phalam is not gained here, next life. It is adrshtaphalam.

We have another vrata or vow here and uapsana. Do not step upon or reject annam. Nowproduce plenty of annam. Production can be understood in two ways. As a farmer one shouldproduce plenty of annam. As householder upasaka, cook extra annam. Not exactly for twopeople or three people. In the next section, the teacher is going to talk about annadanam,entertainment of guest etc as a dharma. So naturally he must be prepared for atithi to come.He must always have extra food. Here the vratam, is produce plenty of annam and cook alsoplenty. This is the third vow. Now the third uapsana. The pair is changed. The type ofupasana is same. Anna-annada-sambandha upasana and pratishtha-pratishthita-sambandha upasana. From one angle, earth is food and space is annada, eater. It is from pralaya angle. Inpralaya five elements resolve. The order of resolution is gross into subtle, subtle into subtlerand subtler in to subtlest. Creation is reverse, from subtle to gross. Our experience is earthresolves into water and water into fire and so on and wind in space. Earth will ultimatelyresolve into space. Space swallows earth. So what? So space is called eater, resolver and theearth as resolved is called eaten, annam. Annam is eaten. First column is eaten column. Itshould be eaten-eater. We cannot call annada-anna in Sanskrit. So this adjustment is to bedone.

In reverse, space is eaten and earth is eater. From the angle of content and container, space ascontent is eaten and earth as container is eater. For example, there is space in your stomach.That is why we keep on putting inside. Space is inside as content. Body is container. Body ismade up of earth, It is parthivam sariram. What ever is within your stomach is called annam.Space is within the stomach. So space is called annam. Container is annada. It is not literal. Itis figurative. Yad yasya antam bhavati, tat tasya annam bahvati. We have to supply prthivi vaannadaa akasah annah.

Next supporter-supported sambandha. From the angle of content-container angle, earth issupporter and space is supported. Space as within is content in pot, stomach, room etc andearth is container. Space will get its value only when it is contained within. When house isbuilt, you are living in space alone which is all over but which has no benefit. What do youown, he was asked. Do you own ground? No. Do you own your floor? No, is ceiling ofanother. etc. For space we pay. But that space is useful only when there is container or fourwalls. Space value is given by the container which conditions the space. Form that angle earthis supporter, earth as building, vessel etc. You cannot bring water in space.



So earth became arrogant. Space said, mind you. I am your supporter. Space is supporter fromthe angle of cause-effect relation. As effect earth is supported. It is the context of creation.Cause alone supports effect. So purvavat. Phalam of annada means he is good eater. Goodeating is sign of health. So he will be healthy. All these results will be for sakama upasaka.Result of nishkama upasaka is purity of mind and single-pointedness of mind. I will be neverarrogant.

May you produce lot of annam. One who is looking water and fire as anna and annada this isvrata. Earth and space is taken here. Space is contained in earth. Space is cloth for earth.Ambaram. Earth is wrapped by space. From another angle, space is in stomach all around.Space is supported by earth. All elements have been covered. All of them are Annam Brahma.Annarupam brahma or karyam brahma.

This section begins with another vratam, honouring of guests or atithi. Atithipujanam. Wehave already seen this in the sikshavalli. Atithidevo bhava. Consider him as isvara iti. Atithimeans guest. Na vidyate tithih yasya. One who does not come with appointment. We disrespect him more. We respect one who comes with appointment. It should be the reverse.Where there is no question of hotels and rooms and selling of food is prohibited, this value ishighly revered. Atithi comes because he is forced to come. When the situation presents likethat, we take it as god's guests or Narayana himself. In the present day it does not work. Soupanishad says: one should not turn away or send back anyone coming to home foraccommodation. If at all such a situation comes, it comes during their pilgrimage. when sunsets, they have to halt in whichever house they see and so it is overnight halt, that too in theveranda. That condition has to be imagined. Vasatau means vasati nimittam. This is thevratam for all people. This is a particular vrata for anna-annada upasaka or pratishtha-pratishthita upasaka. For him it becomes more relevant because he is doing upasana thatwhole world is interdependent. When other members are going on pilgrimage, they aredependent on me and so I should help them so that if I go for such a pilgrimage, I will alsoget the same help from others. Thus with mutual help alone society can survive.

Not only that. Once accommodation is given, food also becomes necessary. They do not carryfood as the pilgrimage involved many years. Previous vrata was may you cook extra food.How can I manage. I do not know how you will do. So upanishad says by any means you doit. It is not adharmic means. Beg, borrow or buy not steal. What the hosts tell to the guests asper tradition of learned people? You should take food with us and should not go withouttaking food. So grhastha says: aradhi asmai annam. It means we have already prepared foodand you need not hesitate. They should not feel bad to ask. Even before they ask, they shouldoffer. Aradhi means already prepared. Subject is upasakas or grhasthas for acakshate. Asmaiatithaye. For these guests annam already prepared. Not only it is a necessary vratam. This willbenefit grhastha also. Whatever he gives will not go waste. It will come to him in a differentcontext. This is an important principle in our tradition. World is like a bank. They trusted thisLord's bank. You love and you will receive love. So upanishad says: if you serve food in thebest manner, you will also get in the best manner.

Etat vai+ Mukhatah means in the best manner, mukhya prakara. Food prepared in the bestmanner and served in the best manner. When he is placed in the similar circumstance, he willget it that way. Raddham means prepared and served. Radhyate means he is also served in



the same manner. If it is mediocre manner, he gets the same manner. Antatah means in thelowest manner. Like for giving to priests etc they have special cheap things. It is not going togive any benefit. What we eat, we give to guests. One who knows thus and practices. Vedadoes not mean upasanam. One who knows the glory of anndanam, and the one who practicesthat, - the upanishad leaves the sentence incomplete. So Sankara completes that such a personwill definitely get the result of annadanam. We are entering into some more upasanas.

तथा पृथिव्याकाशोपासकस्य वसतौ वसतिनिमित्तं कंचन कञ्चिदपि न प्रत्याचक्षीत नप्रत्याख्यानं कुर्वीत। वसत्यर्थमागतं न निवारयेद् इत्यर्थः। वासे च दत्ते हि अवश्यमन्नंदातव्यम्। तद्व्रतम् (*अन्नान्नादत्वगुणकत्वेन पृथिव्याकाशद्वयोपासकस्य स्वगृहे वासार्थमागतं न निवारयेदित्येतद् व्रतमित्यर्थः*।)। तस्माद्यया कया च विधया येन केन प्रकारेण बह्वन्नं प्राप्नुयात् बह्वन्नसंग्रहं कुर्याद्इत्यर्थः। (*बह्वन्नसंग्रहे वसत्यर्थमागतानाम् अप्रत्याख्यानरूपं व्रतमेको हेतुरुक्तः। तत्रैव विद्वदाचाररूपं हेत्वन्तरमाह -यस्मादिति*) यस्माद् अन्नवन्तः विद्वांसः अभ्यागताय अन्नार्थिने अराधि (*राध् ५ प.प संसिद्धौ राध्नोति toprepare*) संसिद्धम् अस्मै अन्नमित्याचक्षते न नास्तीति प्रत्याख्यानं कुर्वन्ति, तस्माच्च हेतोःबह्वन्नं प्राप्नुयात् इति पूर्वेण संबन्धः।

The one who looks upon prithivi and akasa as Brahman, for him there is vratam. Previouslyhe was told to gather lot of annam. What for that annam - that is said. Why not just enoughfor oneself. Distribute that annam. For this upasaka whole space is Brahman. So there is nomy house. He has lot of accommodation in mind. So for the sake of dwelling, whensomebody comes and asks for dwelling, who ever it is, do not turn him away. Suppose yougive him some space. Then you should give annam also. If you are Brahmin, then by teachingand by officiating in yaga, thereby get enough annam. Or he receives also by pratigraha, asdakshina. So there is legitimate way of earning anything for every varnam. It is not bysmuggling etc. In one manner or another. By means foul or fair. No. In fair means many waysare there. May you garner lot of annam. Annam is all types of wealth.

When lot of annam is there, then only a vidvan can say, ‘food is ready, please come' iti. If heis starving, then he cannot offer. He is viveki as well as vidvan. They tell this seeker of foodthus - Food is ready. You cook food always for one or two persons extra. They do not say,there is no food here. This is tradition. So somehow or other you gather enough food. This isalso hetu for gathering more food.

(*एवं संगृहीतमन्नं सर्वदा पूजापुरस्सरमेव अर्थिभ्यः देयं, नान्यथा, 'श्रद्धया देयम्' इत्यादिदर्शनाद् इत्याशयेनाह - अपिचान्नदानस्य इति*) अपि च अन्नदानस्य माहात्म्यम् - यथा यत्कालं प्रयच्छत्यन्नम् तथा

Now further, there is glorification of anna dana. There are two types of danam. One vidya andanother food. You never become poor by giving annam. So too by giving vidya. Brhamavidyadanam alone, he will say enough. Anna danam - it does not come totally. May be for the timebeing he will say enough. Purnah. Even though he may be sad that so much is there, still Icannot eat. He may not say trptah. But he will say purnosmi. I cannot take anymore iti. Invidyadanam it is always purnah. In annadana, he is ready after another three hours. It istemporary. Annadana has mahatmya. Annam is Brahman,. It does not belong to you. Whattime he gives, that time alone he gets back in the next life. In middle age some give. Thenthey get back in middle age next life. Because it is apurvam. In old age he gives because sonsare useless. I am not going to give you anything iti. He will get that time or in the next life inthe same form.

How do you say he gets it back same form. Mukhatah means at the prime age or young age.When he gives food. How does he give is also mukhya. Mukhya vritti means by proper vrittior manner. With what words and attitude he gives is mukhya vritti. It is acara. With respectand worship is mukhya vritti. He gives the food that is ready. What is the result that accruesto him? That is said now. Radhyate means siddhyati. Mukhatah means when he is young. Hedoes not become poor by giving food. Also he gets back with respect and worship. In propermanner it comes to him without struggle. Whatever he touches it becomes gold. Suppose his prarabdha is totally against that kind of annam etc, then next janma. When he gets back heagain gives. Because of samskara and viveka he continues to give. If he gives in forties or bymiddle conduct or etiquette (*16 upacaras*) with words and actions. Heart is not there but wordsare there. Jaghane bhavah is destroying attitude. Paribhava is anadara. This fellow performedmarriage. The village stops cooking in their houses. When they come to the marriage, theyhave to be told please ask. Do not hesitate. The third fellow cannot see so many people eating. He went to store room and locked himself. People searched for him. They found him out. Hewas told - please go and do upacara. Rice is only RS. 10/- Please eat well. Onion is onlyRs 100 per kilo. Please eat well. In the same form it comes back. The idea is annam should begiven. One who does anushthana knowing this very well the glory of annam (*as pujyam andall this is annam*) and also the glory of annadana, and also the result for that as mentioned,then he gets that result. It is karma phalam. It is danasya phalam. By knowing you do not getanything. Only for action there is phalam.

Refer to Sattvika, rajasa and tamasa danam. (*datavyamiti yat+*) (*yattu...phalamuddisya.. diyateca pari.. taddanam rajasam+) (adesa..yadanam.. apatrebhyasca..asatkrtam. tattamasamudahritam*)

We are getting some Brahma upasanas. Brahman in its pure form cannot be meditated upon.It is going to be gunavisishta Brahman. Brahman with various types of glories. These gloriesare manifest all over the world as we see in the vibhuti yoga of Gita. In the first set ofupasanas, we will take individual organs for upasanas. The glories of our various organs.Generally we see this glory as belonging to the organ. In this upasnaa, we will see this gloryas belonging to Brahman. Since individual organs are taken for upasana, we call it thereforeadhyatma upasanas. Upasana of Brahman in the form of Glory residing in the individual.Adhyatmam means individual based. Later we will go to adhideiva upasanas. There theglories of devatas, the samashti, will be the subject.

The Upanishad does not use the word adhyatma upasanas. It uses manushih samajnah.Manushi means adhyatma. Samajnah means upasanas. A few are given. Kshemah iti vaci.First organ taken is vak, organ of speech. Upanishad sees all the well being of a person isresiding in the speech alone. A person can make his life because of nice speech or he candestroy his life because of wrong speech. Lakshmirvasati jihvagre. Wealth is in the tip of thetongue. Jihvagre mitrabandhavah. Bandhanam caiva jihvagre. Jihvagre maranam dhruvam.Say the wrong thing, you invite trouble. Salman Rushdie wrote Satanic Verses. Book is vak.Speech can create revolution. Sales representatives survive because of their tongue. One suchperson said to people - I showed you the competitor's product. I will show mine in the nextdemonstration. Vaci mangalarupena brahma varttate. Brahman resides in the speech askshema. It is Brahma upasanam in the form of kshema.

The next is prana and apana. Exhalation and inhalation. It also means respiratory and excretory system but here it is not that. Breathing alone is to be seen as yoga and kshema.Yoga is apraptasya praptih. Kshema is rakshanam of it. Acquisition and preservation. Thesetwo are to be seen in prana and apana. All acquisitions and preservations are possible only if aperson is alive. They will become meaningful if a person is alive. A big house is built, but theperson collapses at the end. What is the use of that house. Whatever distance he runs in a dayupto that he will gain land. He ran faster and fell and died. What is the use? Meditate onBrahman as yogakshema in prana and apana.

Here you should remember that the Upanishad does not complete the sentences. It leavesevery sentence incomplete. In the form of kshemah in vak. That much alone is there. We haveto supply 'one should meditate Brahman.' Vaci kshema iti brahma upasita. Pranapanayohyogakshema iti Brahma upasita.

Karmeti hastayoh. In the hand what is the power. It is karma. If you take a note book andwrite what all things done by the hands, it is endless. So much power is there in hand. Twosmall hands. It is the glory of Brahman. Padayoh gatiriti Brahma upasita. In feet asmovement. Value of leg will become clearer when you become old. Every bone and muscleyou will become aware of. payau+ payuh means organ of excretion. Anus. Vimuktih meansevacuation. It is asaucam this is our concept. Any organ if you think is inferior, if it doesnot function, we will know its importance. It is as important as the mouth is. If that cycle is



not maintained, a person cannot survive. This upasnaa is to get an idea that everything issacred in the universe. You cannot look down upon anything. So respect every organ of yourbody. Thus is concluded the upasanas pertaining to manushya. One more will come later fromthe next section. Prajatih amrtam anandah iti upasthe. In the organ of generation Brahmanmust be meditated as the creative power in the genital organ. This is also adhyatma upasana.

Atha daivih. We have to supply samajnah. Samajnah means upasanani. Daivih meansadhideivata. Previously it was adhyatma. Now adhideiva. We are going to take cosmic forces.We think that these forces belong to nature. But Upanishad says they do not belong to inertnature. They belong to cetana Brahman. Each power in nature will be taken and we willmeditate on Brahman as manifesting in various places.

We will take one odd upasana out of this group. It is adhyatma upasana. It is prajatiriti+ It ismanushih+ Here the organ is genital. In what form the upasana is done? As progeny. The kulaparampara. You should remember the whole parampara is maintained because of theproduction of son and grandson etc. So the creative organ is responsible for that utpatti. Whena child is born, they call it vriddhih. It is growth of family tree. Amrtam means immortality.Why immortality? Father is reborn in the form of child as it were. So child is supposed to bethe image of the father. We say genetics. Father immortalises himself through the children.That is why whenever a person dies, they report he is survived by... He lives in the form ofthem. Peran means one who has same name (*peyar*) as himself. Finally anandam. Thepleasure of giving birth to the child. It is ananda to see one's creation. In the form of progeny,in the form of immortality and in the form of pleasure Brahman should be meditated on theorgan of generation.

Now adhideiva upasanas. Adhideivam refers to various forces in nature. Each power in natureis the glory of a devata. Rain is a fantastic force of nature. It is supposed to be the power ofvaruna devata. We are taking some such glories in the total. So it is called adhideivam.Adhyatma means vyashti level glory. First rain is taken. In the rain what is the glory? Triptih.Rain gives contentment to all people. Especially to Madrasis. Drinking water and cultivationis through rain. So through plenty of food, there is contentment. Annam gives tripti to all.Normally we attribute this tripti to the rains. But in this upasana, this tripti is not attributed torain, but to Brahman. So meditate on Brahman as tripti in the rain. Tripti rupena vrshtauBrahma upasita. Sentences are incomplete. We have to add Brahma upasita.

Bala rupena vidyuti Brahma upasita. Vidyut means lightning. You know lightning containstremendous power. Millions of voltage. Our energy problem will go if we can tap theelectricity form one lightning. Balam is sakti. Indra's weapon is called thunderbolt.Thunderbolt is this alone. One should see Brahman as balam in lightning.

Pasu means cattle. Cattle in olden days is the wealth of a person. The more the cattle, themore prosperous he is. He is therefore well known in the society for his prosperity. So pasu isa symbol of yasas meaning fame. Pasushu yasorupena Brahma upsita. Jyotih is brilliance orlight. Meditate on Brahman as light in the stars. Comparison of Brahman to light is only formeditation. People misunderstand and say Brahman is light. I saw Brahman and all. Nextsentence, Prajati +, should go to adhyatma upasana. Then Brahman is to be meditated upon aseverything. Sarvam khalu idam Brahma is not a sentence we should quote here. That is jnanavakyam. Where? In the space.



(*प्राणो वा अन्नम् इत्यारभ्य ब्रह्मोपासनानि उक्तानि इति सूचयति - इदानीमिति*) इदानीं ब्रह्मणः उपासनप्रकारःउच्यते - क्षेम इति वाचि। क्षेमः नाम उपात्तपरिरक्षणम् (*स्थितपरिपालनम्*)। ब्रह्म वाचि क्षेमरूपेणप्रतिष्ठितम् इति उपास्यम्। योगक्षेम इति (*प्राणे योगरूपेण अपाने क्षेमरूपेण च ब्रह्म प्रतिष्ठितमितिउपास्यमिति विभागः*) योगः अनुपात्तस्य उपादानम्। (*प्राणापानयोः योगक्षेमरूपेण ब्रह्मदृष्ट्यालम्बनत्वे हेतुमाह -तौ हि इति*) तौ हि योगक्षेमौ प्राणापानयोः सतोः भवतः, (*ननु यदि प्राणापानाधीनौ योगक्षेमौ तर्हि तावेवप्राणापानयोः द्रष्टव्यौ, न तु ब्रह्म इत्याशङ्क्य आह - तथापीति*) तथापि (*प्राणापाननिमित्तकत्वे अपि*) नप्राणापाननिमित्तौ एव। किं तर्हि। ब्रह्मनिमित्तौ (ब्र*ह्मनिमित्तौ अपि इत्यर्थः। ब्रह्मणः

Now the various ways of meditating on Brahman or looking upon Brahman. Brahman, karanaBrahman, or Isvara is everything. Where we have to look for him? That is said here. In thespeech, Bhagavan is there. How he is sitting? As one who protects you, your dignity, yourculture, your wealth, your health etc. Wrong talking means you get it. Look at in the vak asthe kshema. So you have to be careful in talking. Kshema means protection of what is earnedor gained. All kinds of wealth, your name, your power, your wealth and health - all these havebeen assiduously gathered by you over time. All of them are wealth. Retention of that is noteasy thing. Look at lord in the form of kshema in your vak. If you remember this, your wordswill be measured and protective. If you do not look upon so, then you become loose intalking. Lord does not protect you then. There is one iti word is there. It indicates what youhave to superimpose and where you have to superimpose. If you say vak is Brahman, that is samanadhiakranyam. Badhayam+. When you say iti, look upon mind as isvara. Iti will bethere for upasana or Upasva etc. will be there. May you look upon isvara as a blessing ofprotection in your words.

Yoga+ All your yogakshema is possible only when you are healthy. Health is indicated byprana andapana. If there is no health, no yoga and kshema, not even asana yoga. The wellbeing of this person is yogakshema. Since they depend on prana and apana (*but ultimatelydepend on Brahman*) so in the prana and apana (*seventh case*) look upon Isvara asyogakshema. It is not by my wits or strength I gain yogakshema. When any phalam isaccomplished think it is due to Isvara. Similarly in the succeeding portion, look uponBrahman as in the respective forms. In the feet the locomotion is there. That function isparamesvara. See as such. When you are moving your hands, you do not recognise the giverof function. All karma is produced by Brahman. Without Isvara's manifestation askarmendriya and also of the function that is there and the adhishthana devatas involved,karma cannot be accomplished. So in the hand, in the form of karma alone Brahman exists.Hands are for karma. That means you cannot forget Brahman even when you are scratching.In the form of motion, in leg. In the anus, vimocanam or in the form of clearance Brahman is



there. Thus is the adhyatma upasanas, centred on human beings. Sam + aang + jna. It meansjnanani. They are centred on human body, mind etc. Vijnanani because many forms ofmeditations are given.

अथ अनन्तरं दैवीः दैव्यः (*छान्दसम्*) देवेषु भवाः समाज्ञाः उच्यन्ते। तृप्तिरिति वृष्टौ। वृष्टेःअन्नादिद्वारेण तृप्तिहेतुत्वात् ब्रह्मैव तृप्त्यात्मना वृष्टौ व्यवस्थितमित्युपास्यम्। तथा अन्येषु तेनतेनात्मना ब्रह्मैव उपास्यम्। तथा बलरूपेण विद्युति। यशोरूपेण पशुषु। ज्योतिरूपेण नक्षत्रेषु।प्रजातिः अमृतम् अमृतत्वप्राप्तिः पुत्रेण (*पुत्रजन्मना* *पितृऋणमोक्षद्वारेण या पितुः अमृतत्वप्राप्तिः सा अत्रअमृतपदेन विवक्षिता इत्यर्थः*) ऋणविमोक्षद्वारेण आनन्दः सुखमित्येतत् सर्वमुपस्थनिमित्तं (*यस्मात् तत्सर्वमुपस्थहेतुकं तस्मादनेनैव रूपेण ब्रह्म तत्र स्थितमित्युपास्यम् इत्यर्थः*) ब्रह्मैव अनेनात्मना उपस्थे प्रतिष्ठितमित्युपास्यम् (*इदमुपासनम् 'विमुक्तिरिति पायो' इत्यत्रैव द्रष्टव्यम्। आध्यात्मिकत्वात्*)। सर्वं हि (*हियस्मात् सर्वमाकाशे प्रतिष्ठितं तस्मात् यत्सर्वमाकाशे वर्त्तते तत्सर्वरूपेण आकाशे ब्रह्मैव प्रतिष्ठितमुपास्यमित्यर्थः*)आकाशे प्रतिष्ठितम्। अतो यत्सर्वम् आकाशे तद् ब्रह्मैव इत्युपास्यम्। ('*तत्प्रतिष्ठा' इत्यत्रब्रह्माभिन्नमाकाशमुपास्यं केवलस्य आकाशस्य उपास्यत्वायोगात् इत्याशयेन तस्य ब्रह्माभिन्नत्वमाह - तच्चेति।* *सर्वाश्रयत्वेनप्रकृतमित्यर्थः*) तच्च आकाशं ब्रह्मैव।

Now adhideiva upasanas. Devih is chandasam. It should be deivyah. With reference to devas.Rains are cause for satisfaction through food etc. Etc. means water. If there is no food, anyindustrialisation will not give tripti. You have to eat nuts and bolts. Isvara alone is in the formof satisfaction that you see in food. You see rain but what you feel is tripti. So too in otherthings Brahman is to be meditated in the respective forms in those things. Not look yasas incattle. See Brahman as the yasas that is there in the cattle. Lightning can strike anythingdown. It may be winking. But when you touch, you will know the power. Cow is wealth. Youmust have land for maintaining cows. So you own land. Even now in villages they will say Ihave a cow and a buffalo. It is the real wealth. Other wealth is only a tender, a monetarysystem. It is just a paper which Governor of RBI promises that he will give you gold worth ofone rupee.That yasasis me. So ahankara is gone. Amanitvam comes. Isvara is with you insome other form, even if money which is isvara goes. In stars, na ksharati is nakshatra, I am inthe form of light. Nakshatra includes sun also. Sun also is a star. In Gita it covers moon also(*as luminaries in the sky in the night*).

Vikumtiriti should go to previous section. Pathakrama is weaker to arthakramah. This ismimamsa. So it is taken to adhyatma upasana. Brahman is in the form of prajati or progeny inthe upastha or Genital. Amrtam here is in the form of relative moksha. Moksha is freedomfrom rnam or debts. Son becomes the means for gaining this moksha. So putra is calledamrtam. Father has incurred some debt. Children have to redeem them. If the debt is not paid,there is papa. So son releases father form that papa. By his rituals etc, father is released fromhalfway home. In preta sarira he hangs around. He is released. Progeny is amrtam and ananda.In India, son pays off the debts of his father. Prajatih is feminine. The capacity to procreate isprajati. Progeny becomes amrtam. Also it is sukham, the pleasure. He is in the genital inthese forms. Prajati rupena, amrta rupena and ananda rupena upasthe Brahman is there. He iseverything in space. Akasa is support for all. All that is there in it is Brahman. Akasa itself isBrahman being product of Brahman.

Swami Paramarthananda

Next is going to be a different type of upasana. Before that, we have to note one point. In allthese uapsanas,the Upanishad does not mention the phalam. In the case of anna and annadaupasana, the phalam was given.(*Annavan annado+ iti*) Any upasana must give phalam. Howto know this phalam. Sankara answers that we have to apply the general law given by theVeda. The rule is whatever be the type of upasana, that will be the type of phalam also. If wehave this rule, the first upasana is kshema iti vaci. One should meditate on Brahman aswellbeing in the speech. Kshema rupa upasana. So phalam will be kshema. So alsoyogakshema. Tripti is phalam for tripti rupa upasana. So also balam etc. Here, the phalam isfor sakama upasaka. Nishkama upasaka gets the cittasuddhi and cittaekagrata is phalam.

This whole section is dealing with akasa upasana. It is a series of akasa upasana. The previousupasana was concluded as sarvam iti akase. The first is meditate upon akasa as the support ofeverything. Tat akasam pratishtha iti upasita. Akasa as having pratishtha guna. Itaccommodates everything. Here a small problem arises. We are talking about the upasana ofakasa. The whole section is dealing with Brahman. Brahma upasana topic we started. Mayarahitam Brahman is not topic here. How akasa comes in the middle. Here akasa is none otherthan Brahman itself. Brahma abhinnam akasam meditate as pratishtha. Akasa identical toBrahman or akasa in the form of Brahman. How it is so? Because akasa is karyam. It isnonseparate from Brahman. Like gold alone is in the form of ornament. The glory of akasabelongs to Brahman. yadyad vibhuti+ So it is Brahma upasana only. Akasa-abhinna Brahmaupasana it is. Akasa word is to be understood as such in this section. Phalam is gain ofpratishtha in life. Children will not desert.

Tat is brahmabhinna akasa. Meditate upon it as mahah, great. Pujaniyah. Mahatvagunavisishta upasana. So he becomes great. That akasa meditate as manah. Mana is intelligence.The thinking power of the mind is called manah here. Phalam is manavan+ Manam is samemeaning. He will become a good thinker. Namah is prostration. Meditate on that akasa as thesalutation. Then all the desired objects will fall at his feet. They will prostrate him as though.He will gain all objects. Asmai means for this upasaka. Kamah is karma vyutpatti. All hisdesires will be fulfilled. (*We have to do all this with nishkama.*) Tat Brahma iti upasita. Here



Brahman is not absolute Brahman. Brahman means big. Meditate on the akasa as the biggestone. Brahma is common noun. Akasa is very vast. The mediator also becomes big.

Parimarah means the agent of destruction. Or the medium/instrument of destruction. parimriyante asmin sarvani, resolution place like grave-yard. Who is that? Tat. That akasa alone.At the time of pralaya everything resolves from gross to subtle. (*Creation is reverse*). Allelements go back to akasa. Akasa is layasthanam. Brahman is mayasahitam Brahman orIsvara. So akasa is called parimarah. Upasaka will destroy all his enemies. Here the enemiesare divided into two types - those whom upasaka dislike and those who dislike the upasaka.Enam dvishantah sapatnah parimriyante. Sapatnah means enemies. dvishantah means whohate the upasakas. Ye apriyah bhratrvyah - bhratrvyah means enemies. Apriyah meansdisliked by upasaka. We have to add mriyante to pari. They also get destroyed.

This mantra can create some problem. Here Upanishad is not suggesting ragadvesha forupasaka and destroying. Destruction can be two-fold. Enemies get destroyed does not meanthey should be physically killed. If they change their mind and become friendly to me, then itis as good as destruction of enemyhood in them. People dislike us for no reason. Suddenlythey start talking. So human mind is mystery. It is conversion of them. Those who are dislikedby upasaka - how? Here also we can take it as symbolic. Enemies are here inner enemies.

Swami Dayananda

May one meditate upon akasa which isthe basis of everything as Brahman. Phalam ispratishthavatvam. he becomes stable with his income, health etc. Kshema iti+ So you will notlose your friends. Only when vag has created the problem, then hands and legs etc come.Yadyatra+ What is to be done is karyam and phalam means that. You gain upasana anurupaphalam. Tad word is upasana. Upasate is plural. Tad is Brahma here according to Vanamala.As told in Gita ch 10 as all vibhutis and so mahat. Meditate as mana or mananam i.e., jnanasakti. Then manavan+ That capacity to think is itself bhagavan. Phalam also same. Worry ismental activity. That is not the mental activity here but vicaratmakam. Bhagavan is in theform of total surrender, absolute humility.

Why? Because of absence of kartrtvam. Tasya kartaram api+ If kartrtvam is there thenahankara is there. Then you try to be humble. The more you try to be humble, more ego isthere as I am the most humble person iti. It is another form of ahankara. But it is a method ofhandling people. If you accept Isvara as the owner of everything, then there is a certainbhavana. That is called humility. There is nothing for you to be proud about. It is some kindof understanding. Bhagavan has absolute humility because akartaram avyayam viddhi. IfBhagavan has ego, then he will get flattered. Then some people will get their things done byflattering. No. He is not the karta. He is akarta also. So he is namah. Not salutation isbhagavan. Humility is prahvibhava, namanam. Thus you meditate Brahman.

The result for this is this: You are nobody. You have no pride. Then all the objects surrenderto him. People whom you love, they come to you. You become an object of attraction. If youhave pride, the other has more pride. So he goes the other way.

Here Brahman is Virat. In the form of entire gross world, virat, who is the biggest. If onemeditates thus, he becomes the enjoyer of all gross objects. Car etc is sthulabhoga sadhana.Literature etc is sukshamabhoga sadhana. Modern music is sthula+ He partakes in theenjoyment of Virat.

Next is in a context. If you invoke the Lord positively, you have positive gunas. If you invokenegatively, then you have negative gunas. You can invoke him as death. Every where deathwill be there. This is not vihitam. This is nishedha sruti. Tam yatha yatha+ it was said. It isreally brought home by pointing out a negative result also. If you invoke the lord in thisparticular destructive form, then you get that result. You also suffer for that result.

Here, all these positive nice things were told. Finally the opposite also. Brahman is samharakarta. If so, then how does he destroy? With the help of vayu. Prana goes away. Vayubecomes accomplice for Brahman. Vayu becomes parimara or death. Brahmanah samharasadhanam is vayu. Yama is in charge. Vayu is means. (*Parasya brahmanah*) Five devatasresolve in vayu. All aditya etc are born of vayu, gaseous form. They go back to vayu. Vayuitself is akasa. Vayorapi mrityu is akasa. Akasa is in the form of vayu. So akasa, vayvatmana,is sadhana for Brahman to do samhara.



The result of this upasana is that all around, whatever enemies are there, those who hate thisupasaka, (*the other type is those who do not hate, but enemies*) those enemies die. So do notmeditate this way. Also, those whom he does not like they also die. Bhratrvyah are sons ofbrother (*nephew*). But generally there is fight between them when there is joint property. Solong as brothers are there, no problem. One brother dies means fight. This is all over theworld. Joint family is problem. Even in those days, bhratrvyah were called enemies. Eventhough they do not hate you, they also die.

We saw adhyatma, deivi and akasa (*brahmabhinna*) iti three upasanas. Previous anna andannada upasanas (3). Upasanas are over with this. Now Upanishad wants to come back tojnanam topic and conclude this valli by talking about jnana phalam. Why coming back tojnanam topic. Otherwise we will say Taittiriya talks about upasanas for destroying enemies.

What is the jnanam that one gets through vicara - that is given here. This sentence we havealready seen in the previous valli. It is mahavakya pointing out that the ananda atma presentin the jiva and the ananda atma present in isvara - both are one and the same. Anandapratibimbam, the reflection of that ananda may vary, because it depends upon the amount ofsattva guna of mind. More sattva, more reflection. The gradation is only in reflected ananda oranandamaya kosa-ananda. This is the knowledge that the upasaka will get after getting cittasuddhi and after going to guru once again and doing vicara.

The phalam for this jnanam is said here. Sa ya evam vid+ iti. This portion also we have seenelaborately in previous valli. The idea is this: The one who knows thus withdraws hisidentification from all the anatma. First anatma belonging to the external world like son,house etc. They are mamakara vishaya. Thereafter he withdraws form anatma in the form offive kosas in which there is ahankara. First asmat lokat pretya refers to mamakara goingaway. Annamayam atmanam+ refers to crossing over the ahankara vishaya. Finally he crossesanandamaya kosa also, disidentifies with that also, then he gets established in his ownsvarupam. He is called jivan muktah. Even after becoming jivanmuktah, he will continue tolive in the world, as long as prarabdham is there. The question comes, how does he live?

That is being said in the final portion.

The one who is established in atma, the one who is a jivanmuktah, lives his life as describedhere. Etad+ He lives all the time singing the following songs. The word sama has twomeanings. One is it is music. He remains singing music means he is always happy. Musicindicates inner joy except in movie. If you take music as harmony, he lives his life inharmony with creation. There is no disturbance or protest. This is one meaning. The othermeaning is (*Sankara's*) samatvam or Brahman. That which is ever samam. Which is alwaysuniform, no ups and downs. He always thinks of, talks about Brahman for lokasangrahartham,for sastra rakshanartham, for paramparanirvartyartham. taccintanam+ Since he does not haveahankara or mamakara he claims nothing as his own and moves around from place to place.He becomes parivrajaka. He is not tied down to a house, a few people, but moves about. Imanlokan sancaran. He freely moves about all over the world.

If so, then how can he observe his acara and anushthanam. Food should be taken from properplace. Food from wicked people, you take negative thoughts also. So in sandhya-vandanamprayer, whatever I have taken form undeserving people, let it not disturb my mind.Yaducchishtam sarvam punantu mamapo asatam ca pratigrahagm svaha.

Here it is said - this person is free from all acaras. He need not observe any rules orregulations. They were followed for gaining knowledge. Once goal is achieved, means are notstrict. He has no saucam. He may observe. But he need not observe. He can happily violate.Eating onion etc are pratishiddha. But for him no compulsion. Kamatah annam asya asti itikamanni. So too kamarupi. Assuming any form according to necessity. No miracles. If he isamidst jnanayogis, he will talk about sastra. If he is amidst bhaktas, he will bhagavan'sglories. If he is amidst karmayogi, he will work with them. He has no ego. He is dvaiti,among dvaitins and so on. Sanakracarya stands as a simple devotee, whether saivaite orvaishnavaite or sakta, in the stotras he has written. Roles are name and form. Any role can beaccepted by advaitin. So kamarupi. Thus moving about - anusancaran.

All the time what is present in his mind is I am everything. In every vyavahara triputi is there.Seen, seeing and seer. Here eating vyavahara the jivanmukta talks about. He says I am all thistriputi. With wonder he utters this. Aho indicates wonder. Aho in samaveda, since it issamaveda, is changed to havu. Thrice repeated to indicate it is the greatest wonder - advaitaappearing as dvaita. Ekam becoming aneka is not wonder like seed becoming many throughtree. Here eka does not become aneka but appear as aneka without undergoing any change.Aghatita ghatana patiyasi maya.

Because anna upasana was just now completed, eating action is taken. I am annam, eaten. Iappear as annam. It indicates the object of eating action. It is representative of all objects viz.seeing, talking etc. So too I am annada, eater, the subject of the action. This is alsorepresentative. I am slokakrt. Sloka means combination. Slokakrt means one who combines



them. I am the instrument which combines the eater and eaten etc. If pramata and prameyacomes together, I am pramana. Why three times repeated? To emphasise. It is truth, wholetruth and nothing but truth. Truth if we say, it may not have that emphasise. Some mixture. Oryou can say repetition is for expressing wonder. You keep talking about something wonder.Heart is so full that you keep talking about it.

Prathamaja means first born. Who is he? HG. Brahma devanam+ He is not one among thefirst born. Rtasya. It means the whole creation. I am the eldest in the whole creation. Becausebefore all beings. Even before devas. Jnani says so. He may be 30 years old. That means HGis also myself. Because I am everything. Purvam devebhyah goes with previous sentence.Amrtasya+ nabha-i. Nabhi is nabha-i. I am the source, centre of immortality. Nabhi is navelor spoke-centre.

Yo ma+ Jnani is talking as though he is annam. Who ever gives me to others, whoever isdoing annadanam, he. ith means in this manner. Ma avah means preserve me (*or protect me*).They preserve me in this manner. Me is again annam. In this manner means by giving. It is anindirect value of giving. Do you want to preserve money? Do not give to others. Vedantasays - give plenty. Whatever you give comes back to you ten fold. If you want to preserveknowledge, give. Like well. This is reminder of the mantras etadvai mukhatoannagm+ If a person eats me, (*annam*) without giving to others, Aham annam - annam adantam who eats
-aham admi I eat them. Bhunjate te tu agham papah. At least give to crows.

In short, I pervade the entire universe. Aham bhuvanam abhyabhavam. I overwhelm means Ipervade. Visvam means entire. An example is given. Suvah na jyotih. Jyotih meanseffulgence. Na means like. Suvah means sun. Like the light of the sun which pervades thewhole universe, I also pervade the whole universe. I am sarvatma asmi. Sarvatma bhava, theysay. This is one way of describing moksha. Becoming all. Those jnanis attained liberation.Hereafter whoever attain this knowledge, they also will attain sarvatmabhava. Ya evam veda,sah.. we have tio fill up rest. Sa etadsamagayannaste etc. Thus ends upanishad. Iti upanishadsamapta.

Introducing sa yascayam, Bhashyakara, he brings to attention what was said before in thissection on upasana to connect it to the jnanavakya. Here starting prana is annam, body isannada, upto earth and akasa it was concluded. All of them are karyas. Brahman is karana. Letit be said. What do you get out of it? So what? What is accomplished? Bhogya and bhoktaboth are falling in karya. Samsara is characterised by these two. Set up by enjoyed andenjoyer. So samsara is karya vishaya. It is set up by upadhi. So in atma there is no samsara.



Even though it was upasana section, it reveals a factor. It is with reference to karya and atmabeing karana, it has no samara. If ‘I am samsari' is the experience, that samsara is imputed toatma due to ignorance.

Jiva is never created. When we say bhokta and bhogya is karya, then jiva being bhokta, iskaryavishaya. There no bhokta without atma. Is there an atma other than bhokta. Atma itselfis bhokta. So bhoktr rupa atma and bhogya rupa atma both are karya. So atma is created.These various beings are born, when we say, jiva-atma is not born. It is only upadhi that isborn. Because of which upadhi you call a being is human or animal etc. that upadhi alone isborn. Jiva is anadi. So bhoktr rupa karya is not atma. With reference to upadhi, bhoktrtva ispointed out. Bhoktrtva is superimposed on atma. It is upadhi dharma. If it is understood, it isupacara. If it is not understood, it is due to delusion that one talks about it as for atma. Atma iskarya iti he doubts. For many this is siddhanta that all jivas are created. So samsara is properfor atma, atma being one of the products. Atma is karya being separate from everyone, beingdivided like space. All theologies are based on this argument that atma is born.

No. Entry sruti makes it very clear that parah atma alone having created, entered. Tat isobject, karma. Where atma entered. Buddhi is karya upadhi where it entered. Why not in earthetc? In the place where you experience the world, there alone as paratma it has to enter.Cetana atma obtains in buddhi and thereby becomes paramatma. So the entry place is buddhi.Atma is not karya, because para atma alone obtains in karya upadhi. There is no other atmathan paratma entered. The brief statement is elaborated. Anupravesa sruti is set up to point outthe identity between jiva and isvara. satyam jnanam anantam brahma is asamsari by the verydefinition. So paratmanah no samsara, we have to say first. He entered. This is sruti. Soidentity is clear. Jivatma is not therefore karya. So not samsari.

Why not we put this way. Bhagavan created the world. Jiva entered into it. Jiva is anadi. Theyare waiting for the house to built. Like Govts build hutments. People are waiting to occupy.Jivas are waiting for houses. They have applied for it. They are in waiting list. So Lordprovided the houses. So jivas entered. Why not? No. It cannot be that. Ktva suffix cannot fitin. It has to be samana karta. Refers to action of purvakala. Why Panini? You will understand.Thinking that you have studied, Sankara does not say anything else. Both creator and enterershould be same. Without creation you cannot enter. Also purvakale is there. Upapatti isexplained further.



प्रविष्टस्य तु भावान्तरापत्तिरिति चेत्। (*प्रविष्टस्य बुद्ध्यादिकार्येषु उपादानतया सृष्टिसमये एव सिद्धस्य परस्यजीवरूपभावान्तरात्मना परिणतिः एव प्रवेशः विवक्षितः, अतो न प्रवेशलिङ्गात् तयोः एकत्वसिद्धिः इत्यर्थः*)। (*अस्यचोद्यस्य प्रागेव निरासपूर्वकं प्रवेशपदस्य अर्थान्तरपरत्वेन व्याख्यातत्वाद् नैवमिति परिहरति - न, प्रवेशस्य इति*) न।प्रवेशस्य अन्यार्थत्वेन प्रत्याख्यानत्वात्। (*ननु जीवरूपेण परिणामं विना एव परस्य बुद्धिसंबन्धात् संसारित्वेनभानमेव प्रवेशपदार्थ इति पूर्वव्याख्यानम् अयुक्तमिति शङ्कते - अनेन इति*) अनेन जीवेन इति विशेषश्रुतेःधर्मान्तरेण (*जीवरूपविकारान्तरात्मनैव प्रवेशः न तु अविकृतस्य एव परस्य, अन्यथा जीवेन इति विशेषणवैयर्थ्यापत्तेःइत्यर्थः)* अनुप्रवेशः इति चेत्। (*यदि जीवेन इति विशेषणबलात् जीवस्य ब्रह्मविकारत्वं तत्राभिप्रेतं स्यात् तदावाक्यशेषविरोधः प्रसज्येत इति दूषयति - न, तत्वमसि इति*) न। तत्वमसि इति पुनः तद्भावोक्तेः (*जीवस्यआकाशादिवद्विकारत्वे तस्य ब्रह्मैक्योपदेशविरोधः इत्यर्थः*)। (*अभेदोपदेशस्य अन्यथासिद्धिमाशष्टते - भावान्तरेति)*भावान्तरापन्नस्यैव तदपोहार्था संपदिति चेत्, (*जीवलक्षणं भावान्तरम् विकारान्तरमापन्नस्य एव सतः परस्य संसारित्वप्राप्तौ तदपोहार्था जीवपरयोरभेदध्यानलक्षणा संपत् तत्वमसि इत्युपदिश्यते, न पुनर्जीवस्य ब्रह्मविकारत्वविरुद्धम् ऐक्यमुपदिश्यते, अतो न वाक्यशेषविरोधः इत्यर्थः*) (*तत्वमसि इति वाक्यस्य संपदुपासनापरत्वे मानाभावाज्जीवस्यविकारत्वे नाशापत्या न जीवो म्रियते इति वाक्यशेषविरोधात् वास्तवस्य संसारस्य संपदा अपोह - असंभवाच्च तत्वमसिइति ऐक्योपदेशः एव सोयं देवदत्तः इतिवदिति परिहरति - न। तत्सत्यम् इति*) न। तत्सत्यं स आत्मा तत्वमसिइति सामानाधिकरण्यात्।

Another purvapaksha. Person is never the same. Once you get into something like maritalstatus, is never the same. He has undergone change. After marriage he is never the same,undergone thorough change, put on weight. He is unemployed. He got a job. He is differentperson now. Samankarta is there. I understand. But having entered, he is not gong to be thesame. He entered into wrong place. What kind of karya he entered into? My buddhi. Mybuddhi you know what it is. I know it. He is out. He is not going to be the same. He cannotretain his svarupa. So he is samsari due to entry. This is called descent of man, they say. Itcould be descent of god. It is not right. The purpose of entry has already been explained.Pravesa is nothing but upacara pramatrtva due to association with mithya upadhi, withoutreally undergoing any change and appearing as one possessed of samsara due to thatassociation. Since he is available in buddhi upadhi, so pravesa. The word pravesa is used forachieving two things: 1) Karta has not undergone any change, having created he enteredmeans he has not undergone any change. and 2) That atma obtaining in buddhi is not separatefrom Paratma, revealing identity are the two purposes of pravesa. There is no any other entry possible we showed. It is entry iva entry like space having entered into pot. It is withoutentering. That means space outside and inside are one and the same.

In Chandogya, it is seen that paratma entered in the form of jiva. Jivena iti viseshana is therefor atma. Visesha is attribute. Jivatvam is attribute for atma. Assuming another dharma, ornew dharma, it entered. Like even wearing another dress you enter office, not with pyjama.When you come to the class, you do not come with your night dress. So too paratma assumesappropriate qualities like smallness, insignificance etc when entered the body. They aredharma visesha. No. It is not so. If atma has undergone any change to become jiva, then it becomes real. Then you cannot say tattvamasi. Once upon a time, thus you have to begin.Once upon atime my grandfather was the owner of the entire district. Now who are you? The



car I am driving do not belong to me. So ayam atma tat asit iti you have to say. Ayam atmaBrahma you cannot say. Atma was that once upon a time. Now you see my halat. So againbrahmabhava uktah. Such sruti being there.

This cannot be a hetu he says. Bhavantara apatti is my anubhava and your anubhava also.What you are telling may not be true at all. So sukhi duhkhi etc are there. I am a samsari isvery clear to me. You are telling I am Brahman. That sruti statement may have anothermeaning. It may be meant for meditation. Or it has different meaning altogether. No.samanadhikarana is there. This is called mimamsa. Purvapakshi says paratma entered in theform of jiva. To eliminate that jivatvam, (*having entered he found it is mistake and wanted toget out of it*) what he should do? So the sruti enjoins sampat upasana. nikrshtavastuniutkrishtavastu aropa. You are Brahman iti upasita. Jiva is param Brahman. It is not a fact revealing sentence. By that what will you get? Though I am not Brahman, by meditation yougive up your jivatvam in some form. By the power of meditation. It is not mahavakyam. It isalpavakyam only.

No. The vakya you are referring has samanadhikaranya. Tat which is satyam is sa atma. Lingavyatyasa is there, vidheya apekshaya. Tat which is karanam is atma which means me.Siddhavastu vishaya vakya it is. A sentence whose subject matter is accomplished fact. Likeeven water is H2O. No upasana here. There is no ‘iti' word here. Again mahapratijna is therewhich is yena vijnanena sarvam+ That cannot be achieved by upasana.

You may say anything. But my experience is mine. I do not feel I am Brahman. You shouldfeeel. It is feel argument. Argument of anubhava. The oneness between jiva and paratma iswhat is attempted by sruti to unfold. Here the argument is: The jiva is samsari because it isseen. The samsaritvam such as I am fat, I am duhkhi etc. these are known to him, experiencedby him. What is within the experience of jiva should be conformed by sruti. Sruti cannotcontradict the experience. Sruti is pramana. But it cannot hurt other pramanas. A pramana thathurts another pramana is not a pramana. How can you say an argument is not valid. Only because it hurts pramana. Suppose you make a statement that horn of a man is useful for ayaga. It is against the pramana of perception. Here also it is against my sakshi pratyakshapramana.

Then on the same ground alone no smasaritvam. Because you say drshtam, so it is not valid.Why? Jiva is of the nature of experiencer, the subject of the experience of samsaritvam. Jivatherefore cannot be samsari. Upalabdha is asamsari. Without samsara being known to you,where is samsari? If the samsaritvam is known to you, jiva then becomes asamsari, one whoknows it. Being samsari, he cannot look at samsara. There is no prama here, but only bhrama.I cannot join paramasvara iti you cannot say. Experiencer is released from samsaritvam byyour own statement.

Then he says atma, jiva is dharmi and he has samsara as dharma. Because I say I am happy,sorrowful etc. Atma is not fat body. That I can understand. Sthuloham etc may be bhrama. Potis blue. Blueness of the pot is not the dharma of the one who sees the pot. So too fatness ofthe body belongs to body and jiva is different from the body. Still, he is samsari. Why?Because samsaritvam is seen as I am happy etc. One is happy, but another is sorrowful at thesame time. In fact my being happy he is unhappy. So each one is different form the other andhe cannot be asamsari paramatma. So he has samsara as dharma. Like fire has heat as dharmathat is intrinsic, so too samsaritva is svarupavisesha of atma.

No. It is not true. Here atma is samsara dharma visishta has to be understood. Atma becomesdharmi where the attributes are located. Samsaritvam becomes attribute. If that is so, is there adifference between dharmi and dharma or not. If different, no samsaritvam. If non-differentand identical, then there will be no recognition of dharma. It will not be possible as dharmacannot be objectified. If fan is moving you do not move. Motion belongs to the fan. You say Isee samsaritvam. If samsaritvam is nature of atma, it is abheda, then it cannot be known and ifstill you say I am samsari atma, then what is the pramanam? Sastra? It cannot tell asamsariatma is samsari. It is anartha, undesirable. If atma is samsari, even hundred srutis cannot makeme asamsari. Sastra does not say. Sakshi ceta kevalo nirgunasca. No it is my experience. Yourexperience - elucidate. Do you see or not. If you see, then you have dismissed. If not seen byyou, how do you make such a statement. If dharma is same as dharmi atma, then dharmacannot be object of experience.

An illustration is given for this. Heat and light belong to fire. Heat does not burn itself. It doesnot become an object of the action of heating. Anything in contact with fire will become hot.Fire does not heat itself. Unless it is not hot, it cannot happen. So too fire cannot illumineitself. Dahya means object of dahana, dahana vishaya. If it has to light itself, then it should beopaque.

Samsaritva is not directly experienced by me. But it is inferred. How do you do it? Fear etc isseen. Anxiety, depression etc. From that I understand they have a basis. There is unconscious



- how do you know? I am conscious. Then it is not unconscious. It cannot be seen. So it isinferred. So samsaritvam is duhkhitvam, being subject tot pain. By fear etc, this duhkhitvamis inferred. No. Feat itself is duhkham. Fear is not very pleasant. It is not basis of sorrow.Itself is sorrow. Duhkhitva is not anumana prapta. He is sad. Because he inferred. Seeing youI was afraid. So I must be duhkhi. Duhkhitva becomes paroksha. No, it is directlyexperienced. Anumeya also is pratyaksha vishaya. Why do you do anumana. You do notinfer that I am sitting here. Why? Because I hear your voice. Do you see. Yes. Then why doyou infer. I like inference. The person eating the chlorate along with the wrapper portion.Some one told you are eating with wrapper. He says I like it. So samsaritvam is not theattribute of upalabdha.

You are holding on to one sastra. You should do samanvaya of all sastras like kapila sastra.They are not ordinary people like Karuppaiah. They are thinking people. We should take themall into our fold. We should see commonness in all of the, (*Trying to see commonness whichis not there is delusion*).

Tarkasastra is vaidikas. That is why they were quoted. They follow the Veda. They have tarkasastra, a sastra based upon reasoning. Kapila is sankhyam. Atmas are many for them. That iswhy atma atmanau atmanah. Sabdamanjari is enough to say atma is many. Oneness of atma isnot there. How do you establish it? By reasoning. They arrive at by tarka and take the help ofsastra which are helpful and give some other meaning where the sruti is not helpful. That isnot looking at sastra as pramana. You try to see what the sastra wants to say. That is the approach of a purusha. They conclude first and with that concluded philosophy look at thesastra. They do not yield to sastra. They have their own agenda and want to prove that.

Tarka has no pratishtha where there is no access for them. In 2^(nd) chapter of Brahma sutra theywere dealt with. So Tarka sastra has to be defective because it is attempting to prove thenature of something that is not available for tarka and secondly, if duality is not true, anylogic employed for proving it is going to be defective. Their arguments has to be defective.My job is to see the defects. That is called mananam. First chapter is sravanam and secondchapter is mananam. Then nididhyasanam (*upasana also talked about*) and phalam.



We reply that we do not care for its opposition because it is not pramana for atma. In thematter of atma, it does not have pramanya svatah, being born of human intellect.Pramanantara anadhigata alone is vishaya for sastra. So it is svatah pramana. It does notrequire the concurrence of any other pramana. It is logical and non-contradictory toperception because seer is different from seen is the basis of it. Tarka is not only notsupported by Veda but it is opposed to Veda. Anumana and anubhava is not hurt by Veda. Ifyour anubhava contradicts then it is bhranti. It is not that your servant says atma is asamsari.There is yukti also. Atma is asamsari, but how it is paramatma. Paramatma is asamsari. Soatma is also. No. Why not two asamsaris? I am one. You are another. So how can there beoneness? One is bearded and another is shaven. No. There is only one asamsari. Manynessonly in samsaritvam. Asamsaritva has no desa-kala-vastu bheda. The ekatvam is due to srutirevelation.

Eka is one who is creator and who entered in the karya. Anupravishta para atma is same as theaparoksha atma (*ayam*) who obtains in the upadhi of buddhi and who obtains in sun(*samashti upadhistha*). If Devadatta atma is Yajnadatta atma, that is enough to show atma isone. Here atma of HG and atma of me are one. The identity of these two atmas (*Devadattaand Yajnadatta, one is intelligent and another fool*) are because of removing upadhidifference, then that argument equally applies to atma between HG and me.

The one who recognises the one vastu between sun and jiva (*purusha means body*) he gainswhat? Atma which was presented as atma later negating as anatma by vidya, upasamkramyameans eliminating the error that it is atma. Pramaya bhramam apohya. He remains singingsama i.e., Brahman. Or it can be sama mantra. Singing the glories of Brahman. He gives theconnection here.

In the anandavalli, the opening sentence was Brahmavidapnoti param. Then a mantra wascited. It is Satyam+ Brahma. It was elaborately discussed in anandavalli. Akasadi karana isBrahman and so satyam. It is not inert because jnanam. Everything being born of Brahman itis ananta. Phalam was also said in sosnute+ But it was not explained in detail. Vipascit issakshi caitanya, sakshi of everything. Ittham bhute 3^(rd) case. In the form of satyam+ Brahman,he gains all objects at once. In what respects the sentence was not discussed? 1) What arethose kamas? 2) What are the objects of desire? 3) How can he simultaneously experience allobjects? Like a sadhu with one bhiksha patram getting bhiksha. Yugapat he takes everythingtogether. Similarly does this jnani allow himself to be rushed by all these objects into him? Heputs them all together and enjoys? These things have to be told? So sastra is talking about ithere. This is between previous valli and this section.

There is also sangati between this valli and the current section. What is said before here? Inthe story of Bhrugu and Varuna which is connected to Brahmavidya talked about in theprevious valli. One visesha was pointed out there. Tapas as sadhanam for brahmavidya.Sadhana is that by which something is accomplished. Sadhana depends on what is to beaccomplished. Which sadhana I should follow? You cannot ask generally. Umbrella issadhana for going in rains. Or beating the other person. Later, two upasanas were presented asanna and annada and its application. Which mantra for what purpose to be used? That isviniyoga. Like for grhas there are mantras. Which mantra for which grha?

Later on told. Practical training. Karyasya viniyoga. The created objects which are sagunaBrahman are available for upasana. These karyas how they can be used in upasanas of annaand annada. Later on upasanas for which Brahman is vishaya was told in kshema iti vaci. Andvarious ends or objects of desire to be accomplished by various sadhanas. They are pratiniyatameaning for this upasana this is the result iti. Very well regulated. Upasanas are many and soends are also many. Upasya or vishaya for upasana is also said. There are two vishayas,objects for upasanas. One is object of meditation. The meditation has an object which isipsitatamam karma. The purpose for which it is meant. The subject matter is akasadikaryabheda vishayas. The various ends were pointed. The idea is that they do not gaineverything. They get some result alright.

The one who has vision of oneness between jiva and isvara, what kind of result he gets? Oncethere is ekatvam there is untenability of having the status of desirer and connection to objectof desire. Connection is established with kama by eliminating the distance by karma etc.There is no karma for him. What will he desire first? You cannot desire for index finger.Because you have it already. (*One may ask for length of index finger.*) That sambandha is notpossible. There is kamin and kama sambandha. Neither he is kamin nor anything is awayfrom him. They are in the form of atma. So how do you say he enjoys all objects? Enjoyment needs duality. Further how simultaneously. Both are not possible. Only in succession he canenjoy. Further along with Brahman how? How Brahman is table partner? Because sruti saysas Brahman. How it is possible?

The whole thing is possible because he gains sarvatmatva due to that vision. It is purelyupacara for sarvatmatva. By knowledge alone it is possible. He explains that. How to becomeeverything? How to gain the status of being everything. Sah evam vit means one who has theknowledge of oneness of atma (*atma in purusha and atma in sun*). By that knowledge he givesup the excellence and non-excellence of upadhi. He resolves the differences of upadhidharmas, upadhi being mithya. Giving up atma buddhi in all the five kosas, which are takenas atma (*atmanah is acc plural*) and which are set up by avidya. Doing this in krama, order.What is left out? Brahma Puccham. Adhishthanam of all kosas including anandamaya. It issatyam+ etc Svabhavikam is svarupa. It is not krtrima, created. Not born. Not die also unlikeignorance. Having gained Brahman, he wandering all the worlds (*bhuh etc*), sitting in oneplace. They take it literally. It is not so. There is no travel involved here. Then onlyyaugapatya can be shown. Evamvit goes to anusancaran. In between distance is created by somany sentences. How he moves about?

Kamanni though subject explains the question katham? Kamatah icchatah. Kamanni istaddhita. Ini pratyaya. Upadha dirgha is i long. There is no let or hindrance for him inmovement. All forms are his forms. Not that he goes all over. At once he has to go all over.How can do that? So being sarvatma, he goes. Seeing these worlds in the form of self. Kimanubhavan? Enjoying what? Sama. Brahman. This Brahman which is under discussion whichis satyam+

Brahman is sama. It does not undergo any change. In Jainism atma changes according to sizeof the body. Jiva when born, atma pervades that body. When body grows atma grows. So it isaffected by the impurities of body. So they do tapas to purify atma. So everything is not oneand the same. That sama he sings. Samatva is explained as nonseparate from all or all are notseparate from Brahman. Sabdayan is making noise? Prakhyapayan - making atmaekatvam known to everybody. Why should he do this? Why should he not talk? When everybody isrunning, he says that towards which you running, or heaven, it is me. How come it is you,when you are sitting in one place. Sit and listen.

Not only singing jnanam of Brahman, but also result of jnanaphalam. Because people areinterested in phalam only. He sings the phalam that is krtarthatvam. One who says I havedone all my duties, sons are all established, daughter is married, etc. He is not ativajrtarthatvam. Because he says I have no peace. He does not say but sings. There is wonder inhis face. Surprised by himself. He cannot believe I am everything. How I could have missedthis so long? Iti. Previously he was trying to keep the body and soul together. \[*Keep the wolfaway* (*means hunger away*)\]. Now he says I am the one who put this sanghata together.

How come there is wonder? Why this wonder? Born of what? kimkrtah means born of what.Sruti says: Atma is pure, not stained by anything. It is nondual. Meaning no type of bheda inwhich. Still I am annam and annada. I have this status because I am everything. Withoutundergoing any change, I am the cause of everything. I have become many without change.That is possible only through maya. That maya is wonder. Aghatita ghatana+ What isimpossible when accomplished is wonder. That food went down when I ate - is not wonder. Itis common thing. In creation it is there everywhere. Because maya is manifest everywhere.All the way it is wonder. When you question it is not there.

Further I am the slokakrt. Three times is wonder. Sloka is verse. It is also samhati orassemblage. Verse is assemblage of aksharas. I am the karta of that sloka. Here the karta is theone who connects the bhokta and bhogya. Only this can be eaten by this person iti there are alot of rules or factors that go into what you eat and keep yourself going. I am omniscient isthe meaning of cetanvan. So I am karmaphaladata which requires omniscience. So I amisvara.

Or sloka can be taken as your physical body. It is annam, put together in a different way. Howthe food taken becomes this kind of body? Outside it is food. Here it is body. Of the foodwhich is inert and so meant for eater, who is cetanah. Any assemblage is meant for somebodyelse like even a house. He has to be conscious being. Room is for furniture you cannot say.Bed room is not meant for light. Food converted in the form of physical body has varieties ofthings like cells, tissues etc. Being anekatmaka, it is meant for conscious being called bhokta. Hand is meant for scratching. Scratching is for whom? For conscious being. That relief is thephala of scratching. It is for bhokta. So I am sanghatakrt. That Lord who put it together is me.So much knowledge has gone into it. Nothing is not there. Chemical factory (*liver*) is there.Pollution free it is. Or minimum.

The three times repetition is to reveal his ascaya or wonder. There is wonder in the creation.That triputi is me. Putting together is not easy. I am prathamaja. I am the first born i.e., HG. Iam the creator. Prathamam jayate iti. I am also virat. That is told by purvam devebhyah. I amborn. Even before devas were born, I am born One who is born before devas is virat. Rtammeans sat-tyam. Sat is murta. Tyat is amurta. Before the creation of jagat that is murtamurta, Iam born. So I am HG and Virat. Devas have to preside the lokas. Previously he was prayingto Agni. Now he says I am that agni.



I am nabhi of moksha. For gaining freedom from mortality, I am the source. Understandingme alone is moksha. Because I am that satyam+Brahman. Who ever gives me. How cananybody give me? He, as food, is talking.

One who does not give food to needy ones, prapte kale means at the proper time. If he ishungry and asking food, if you give at four p.m. no use. I give problem to him having enteredhis stomach. Like Hanuman had stop over when he went to Lanka. He had anima and garima.(*guru plus imanich to indicate quality added. Guru gets gar substitute*) Having gone insidethe surasa he became big. She was burst. Importance of annam must be understood. If noannam is there, no life. Industrialisation means no cultivation place.

A funny amusing argument is brought in here by some brhaspati. If this is so, I am afraid ofmoksha. Moksha in the form of sarvatma, annatma etc. Let samsara continue to exist. Why?Because in samsara I am annada. I eat food. I can choose food. In moksha I lose it. If I amfood, other fellows choose me to eat. Even though I am mukta due to sarvatma, still I willbecome eatable being food as nastika becomes food. Sankara says - do not get frightened. Donot take it literally. Sarva vishaya asana is purely kalpana. Annam and annada both are me. Itmeans I am Brahman. Anna and annada are mithya. Samvyavahara means kalpanamatra. It isa different matter altogether. You are anna as well as annada.

Anna and annada both are set up by avidya. It is by knowledge negating them. Mithya beingnot separate from satyam, me, I am annam and annada.

Then, why it is said I am food etc. Jagat is karya is easy to say. But annada is cetana and howto understand jiva is karya. Jiva upadhi alone is karya and not the whole thing. This anna-annada-lakshanah is kalpana only. Being karya of brahman, they are not separate from it andso brahmabhava being the result of jnanam. That is praised. Drawing your attention to a factis called praise. Bhagavan can never be praised. It is always going to fall short. It is not mereannada now. But annam also. Emotionally you beccome annam or target for some. It is notthat kind of annam. Since I cannot be both annam and annada, it is not reality. Vyakaranajnana grantha is not there. Whiff of fear.

Svatantrya is told here. I resolve everything into me. Bhuvanam and visvam two words arethere. So visvam means all. Sambhajaniyam means obtained by Brahma etc. Isvararupena. Iam not a competitor to Lord. I am in the form of him. I am in the form of order also that is increation. Dharma is myself. Here dental nakara. Not cerebral.

Na means upama. Like sun. I am like sun. Sun does not depend on anything for its light. It issvaprakasa. Still it is parapraksa because depends on me. Atma is like aditya prakasa. It is very important. Nitya jyotih. Thus Upanishad ends. Upanishad means paramatma jnanam.Who ever knows this upanishad in this manner like Bhrugu. Sampatayati means gains. Lethim not say I have not gained and so upanishad is useless. One who has santa etc. Danta is notone who has teeth. He gains this result like ha vu ha etc. Om is chanted for prayer that let thisbhashya bless the seekers.

Summary

In the first six sections, it talked about panca kosa viveka in nutshell. This was not elaboratelydone because done in second valli. The main idea in them is that necessity of guru andnecessity of tapas, enquiry. Seven to nine we got three upasanas and vratams for manda andmadhyama adhikaris. Anna-annada and pratishtha-pratishthita sambandha upasana betweenthree pairs - prana and body, waters and fire and earth and space. Three vratas with respect to



annam. In tenth we got the value of annadanam. Then three sets of upasanas - adhyamikabrahma, adhidevia brahma and akasa upasanas. Upanishad concluded with jnanam(mahavakya) and phalam. Phalam is going beyond mamakara and ahamkara and gainingsarvatma bhava.
